       " ('How did studded leather and heavy eye makeup come to be the Hollywood dress code for dystopian, post-apocalyptic societies?',\n",
       "  'I like to think that leather clothing is rather more durable and easy to fix than an Italian tailored suit.\\n\\nSo in lack of industrial infrastructure (lack of shops, sewing machines, fabric production etc.) Simple and durable clothing would become common.\\n\\nAs for makeup, i guess black makeup (or motor oil, dirt, grit) is easy to pull off than perfectly clean face. To a lot of of observers, the nearest present-day mirror that we have to a dystopian and post-apocalyptic society is the part of our own current society that prefers to dress and appear that way. Biker ~~games~~ **gangs** (edit: used an incorrect worm) are a good example.\\n\\nPeople who dress and wear a whole lot of dark make-up or tattoos are generally seen as tougher and grittier than Joe Average, maybe better armed and organized as well. They and their sideways society or undersociety would likely be better suited to survive an apocalypse when the veneer of civility started wearing thin. So they\\'d take that preference in clothing and make-up with them into their \"new order\" in whatever seedier and grittier universe resulted from the change, to the point where that appearance would become the norm. Inventing a new, believable dress code isn\\'t easy, so when you\\'re depicting a society that\\'s radically different from our current one, an easy solution is picking the dress code of people who are already perceived as antisocial or non-conforming, like punks and bikers. All of the previous 17 answers do shed a great deal of light on this question.  I would also add that there is symbolism in this kind of aesthetic.  These are the less conventional types of fashion choices and they can be used to convey non-conformity.  And so, if you wish to signal a failure of conventional society, and the rise of a more anarchistic, uncontrolled type of human existence, you can use non-conformist fashion to indicate that there is no longer any remaining social convention to which people might conform.\\n\\nBut that is an artistic choice, to send a message to audiences.  If we were to try to predict what a post-apocalyptic society would actually look like, possibly it would just look like a lot of badly dressed people who no longer had convenient access to clothing stores.  There would probably be no such thing as fashion or any prevailing aesthetic, in a world in which people are struggling to survive at all.  It would also be true that if you did feel like wearing eye make-up and studded leather clothing, and you were fortunate enough to have access to those things, chances are there would be nobody to stop you.  Your mother is not going to tell you \"take that off, you look ridiculous\". I think it goes back to Mad Max and George Miller\\'s vision of the future.  Mad Max came out in 1979, are there any dystopian biker gangs in movies that predate that?\\n\\nFake edit:  So I googled and came up with [this page of Australian dystopia\\'s](_URL_1_) and it mentions [The Cars that Ate Paris](_URL_0_) by Peter Weir from 1974 which hugely influenced George Miller; he even referenced one of the film\\'s iconic cars in the latest Mad Max.  \\n\\nSo now the question is, does anything predate this movie or is Pete Weir the one responsible? Some of these answers lean in the right direction. I can add a little conserving spikes and studs. Aside from the \"look\" it gives, studs and spikes can be a bit more practical... Dogs wear spiked collars around their necks to prevent another dog from grabbing hold of it, protecting it from attack. The same idea transferred to the punk aesthetic, with spiked bracelets, collars and such. A well-studded jacket might also turn a fist or knife in a fight. A spiked wrist can\\'t be grabbed. Skinny jeans... Well, those aren\\'t actually that practical. \\n\\n Anecdotally, that was the intent. It took the toughness of leather and denim with an extra layer of protection for rumbling gangs.  Granted, most of what you see in that look nowadays is toned down and mall-ready. \\n\\nIn a post-apocalyptic society, would you be afraid of it was roving gangs of nerds? Probably not. But if the streets were turned over and ran by the shadier element; biker gangs, punks, thugs, etc... You\\'re actually worried about society. There is a lot of human skin lying around that needs to be used, and people don\\'t get a lot of sleep so it isn\\'t eye makeup, they just are really, really tired. I think Hollywood\\'s fascination with the black leather dominatrix look for post-Armageddon societies is kind of silly.  Most likely actual PAS would have a shortage of cloth after a while, and denizens of the post-industrial world would look (and smell) a lot like heavily armed hobos.  While it makes an exciting film, PAS\\'s that have a lot of motor vehicles is also nonsensical and irrational.  PAS\\'s would depend mostly on bicycles, horses, two-wheeled and four-wheeled carts and so on for transportation.  Within a few years fixed ammunition would become difficult to obtain, transportation would become animal-powered and materials scavengers would wreck most complicated machinery (no longer functional because of a lack of electricity) looking for items they could use.  Hunger would be wide-spread and society would slowly devolve into warlordism and feudalism.  Organizations like renegade military units and outlaw motorcycle clubs would create little Somalia-like mini-states.  Regular people, people who either were not heavily armed to begin with, or who were not allowed to join an outlaw tribe would simply become subjects of the warlords.

       " (\"How to explain depression to my spouse who believes it's not a real disease and can be controlled by deciding to not be sad.\",\n",
       "  'Well, let me try to help. I\\'m not a psychologist, psychiatrist or health professional of aky kind, but I have experienced different levels of depression through the last few years, and maybe that qualifies me to provide you some input.\\n\\nThe main issue when trying to explain depression is simply the fact that the word \"depression\" is widely missused to identify \"sadness\". People say \"I\\'m depressed\" when, in fact, what they are experiencing is a normal reaction to a bad situation, such as the loss of a loved one or the end of a relationship.\\n\\nDepression is NOT sadness. Far from it. Actually, if you are sad, and can pinpoint the cause of your sadness, you are not likely to be depressed. In my experience, the word that most accurately describes depression is \"numbness\".\\n\\nYou know when you spend too much time lying on your arm, or too long sitting with your elbows against your knees, and you arm/leg \"falls asleep\"? That\\'s depression, but instead of not feeling anything in your arms or legs, you don\\'t feel any propper emotion. That\\'s why sometimes people DO get depressed after a specially traumatic event, just like your limbs get numb after too much pressure on a certain point. The parts of you that are responsible for feeling certain things simply fail to do so. They \"fall asleep\".\\n\\nDepressed people are usually seen as \"sad\" by others for the simple fact that they are not feeling anything and, therefore, show no signs of stimulation. You tell them something that should be really heartbreaking and they reply with a simple \"yeah, I know, that sucks\", because for them no emotional response was triggered by the information you just provided. It\\'s just like poking a numb limb with a toothpick, and assuming that it is dead because it didnt jerk or twitch or cause that person to say \"ouch\". It is not dead, its just not feeling that poke.\\n\\nThat is tremendously hard to explain to other people for another very simple reason: your subjective experience of life cannot be shared with others. There is no way to do it, no way you can explain someone how the color red looks to you without resorting to some sort of comparisson (\"red is the color of tomatoes and Super Mario\\'s hat!\"), which is a technique that doesnt really work since there is no way to tell if the other person sees tomatoes and Super Mario the same way that you do. Maybe the way I see the color of a tomato is, for you, what you would call green. There is no way to know.\\n\\nSo when your spouse sees your actions and perceives them as a sign of you being sad, he is naturally going to assume that it should be easy to fix by simply doing something fun and chasing the sadness away. He is failing to realize that you cannot experience the sensation of \"something fun\", because the parts of you that are responsible for feeling that are \"asleep\". And when you tell him \"this is not sadness, it is depression!\", what he hears is \"this is not sadness, it is sadness!\", since the word is so widely missused. And then he does something that should make you feel better if you were just sad, but you don\\'t, and he assumes that you simply refuse to feel better, because he can\\'t experience what you are experiencing.\\n\\nTry and get your spouse to do some reading about depression, and ask him to give you some credit and believe that what you feel is different than what he feels. If he is a reasonable guy, he\\'ll get it eventually.\\n\\nFinally, I\\'m sorry you\\'re feeling that way. Its a terrible thing, and it kind of feeds itself be keeping you away from the world. The more depressed you are, the less appealing the world seems to you and you end up doing less and less things, which gets you deeper and deeper into depression. But there is one thing your spouse is right about: you do have to do something about it. It feels wrong, it feels like nothing is going to help because you never feel anything anyway, but you need to look for help, maybe get a therapist, maybe get medicated. \\n\\nThink of it like getting up in the morning to go out for a jog - it feels terrible to do it, and once you do get to it you dont feel any thinner. But if you keep at it, keep doing it even though you are tired or sleepy or lazy, you WILL get thinner, you WILL feel less and less lazy, and it WILL be better for you.\\n\\nTL;DR: Depression is a numbness of the mind, and you cant explain that to people because nobody REALLY understands how another person feels, subjectivelly. Depression is not sadness, it is failure to properly perceive stimulation.\\n\\n(BTW, English is not my first language, so please forgive any grammar mistakes) This cartoon explains it as well as anybody or anything can . _URL_0_ . hang in there dude/dudette. Go to a counselor/psychologist along with your spouse. You speak to the counselor first and explain your situation and then let the counselor speak to your spouse and explain why depression should be taken seriously. When a person is depressed, the immediate family also needs counseling on how to handle the situation. If someone gives you tough-love or compares your issues with someone else\\'s, just ignore them. Does she wear eyeglasses? Take away her glasses and tell her to will herself to have better eyesight.\\n\\nDepression is just like that. One of the biggest difficulties people have, is understanding the Depression is not a symptom, it *is* the malady.\\n\\nYou can have a loving wife, great kids, more money than you can count, a holiday home in the Bahamas, a nobel prize in science, be an Eagle scout and the love of everyone you know, and still suffer from depression. It\\'s not simply being overly sad because small things are bothering you, it\\'s being so compleltey smothered by an all infecting black pall which has sapped your will power, and drained your self-esteem that nothing feels good, nothing tastes good, nothing brings enjoyment.\\n\\nYour spouse is ignorant of depression because she doesn\\'t suffer from it, and as much as her kind of ignorance irritates me, I\\'m glad for her to be that way. I wouldn\\'t sic that Black Dog on anyone. The hyperboleandahalf comic is probably the best representation I\\'ve ever seen. But if that doesn\\'t work:\\n\\n1) Brain chemistry is real - it\\'s responsible for every feeling. It\\'s not \\'feeling sad\\', it\\'s a chemical reaction that makes it impossible to feel positive or happy. You can\\'t think your way into creating another chemical reaction in your brain, it\\'s like saying that you can think your way out of indigestion, or the flu, or cancer. You can\\'t. Diseases are physical things, just because it has an emotional manifestation rather than physical symptoms doesn\\'t make it any different. \\n\\n2) Now this isn\\'t that helpful, but if my partner consistently told me that they think I could feel happier if I wanted to, I\\'d tell them to fuck right off. You don\\'t need to understand depression or have it, but you do need to be a good spouse. That\\'s basically his job. He doesn\\'t need to understand something to know that it affects you or to support you.

That\\'s like saying your leg got broken, why do you need a cast? Can\\'t you just unbreak your leg? Depression in my experience was like... living in molasses. The apathy, the numbness, and the inability to feel motivated to do ANYTHING was the characteristic. Yes, sadness was there.... the part of that cartoon that hit me was walking by the couch and sitting down \"for a minute\" and finding yourself still there hours or days later. I couldn\\'t even get the motivation up to take a shower. Staying in bed, sleeping or laying there hoping I would sleep soon, that was all there was. I had a new husband, was accepted to a new PhD program, and should have been happy. There was nothing for me to be sad about... but yet I was in the blackest, darkest funk that I could imagine. I didn\\'t even think about suicide... not because I cared if I lived, but because that was planning and thought and effort and there was no way that was possible. \\n\\nDepression is absolutely a real disease, caused by imbalances in neurotransmitters or the receptors for those chemicals. Does he believe that ANY mental illness exists? Do people with anxiety disorders need to stop worrying?

I'll go over two below:\\n\\n###PWM\\nPWM, or Pulse Width Modulation, makes the assumption that the average voltage over a wire is just as good as any instantaneous voltage. The voltage is switched on and off really fast and the duty cycle, or percentage of the time the voltage is on, multiplied by the peak voltage is equivalent to the average voltage over a wire.\\n\\n###Resistor Ladders\\nResistor ladders are how digital to analog converters work along with analog video signals such as VGA. The same voltage is fed into a bunch of resistors, each individual resistor's source controlled by a digital logic. The voltage out of each resistor added up is equivalent to the output voltage. The advantage of this technique is that it does not rely on average voltage but rather the instantaneous voltage. It is, however, limited in resolution (number of possible voltages) by the size of the resistor ladder whereas PWM is limited by a timer on a microprocessor.\"),\n",

       "  'For decades, GO has been the go to example of a game that computers suck at. I remember discussing it in CS classes when talking about chess playing computers. \\n\\nWhile I don\\'t remember the rules of the game, its supposed to be a game that is simple for the human mind, but mathematically extremely complex and difficult to turn into computer code, given the rules and strategy of the game.\\n\\nThe fact that Google has built an AI that can play is a pretty big step in the direction of machine learning, which is itself a step in the direction of actual AI systems. Computers are really good at searching through a bunch of options really fast, but they have their limits. In games like chess, there are only a handful of possible moves, so the computer can test all possibilities up to a certain number of steps ahead then calculate which move is best. In games like Go, for every possible move, there are almost just as many possible moves after that one. As the article points out, the order of magnitude of possibilities grows insanely large very quickly. So even a computer checking one million moves every second couldn\\'t search very far ahead within a reasonable time.\\n\\nPeople, on the other hand, are very good at patterns and generalizations. Those well versed in the game recognize these patterns and can quickly estimate the outcome of a particular move without actually calculating every one. Random tidbit, in TRON:Legacy, the game that Quorra (a program/AI) complains she can\\'t usually beat Flynn (a user/human) at is go. (Edit: after making my comment, which was based on knowing the previous history of Go AI and reading Google\\'s announcement, I got a copy of the published paper. The abstract makes AlphaGo sound more like a very, very powerful Monte Carlo program, and if that\\'s the best description it makes a lot of what I\\'ve said below irrelevant. I won\\'t know exactly what role the neural network/machine learning approach has in AlphaGo until I read the whole paper.)\\n\\nForty years ago, AI fans imagined that with the rapid growth in processing power, computers could eventually be instructed to brute-force any intellectual task that humans were capable of.  That turned out to be impossible (too many possibilities to brute-force).  Next AI fans thought that, at the very least, you could teach computers to follow all the same rules that humans follow.  That turned out to be much more complex than anyone had imagined, because applying these rules sensibly involves a huge amount of tacit information humans don\\'t think about much.\\n\\nFor a long time it looked like the next best thing might be \"Monte Carlo methods\" - i.e., the computer plays out hundreds of thousands of games randomly, having both sides play idiotically simple moves. Then you assume the more of the idiot-games black wins, the better black\\'s position is in reality.  This worked surprisingly well, but it petered out against top amateurs.  The problem was that, from the point of view of a strong player, it doesn\\'t matter whether 9,999 out of 10,000 possible games would end in a loss, if all of the moves along the winning branch can be forced.\\n\\nUsing a neural network was something that was suggested a while ago, but never emerged as the top approach.  The reasons this is exciting:\\n\\n1. It\\'s a really hard problem that people have been working on for a long time\\n\\n2. Every small-ish, seemingly trivial AI triumph, like Tic-Tac-Toe or chess, is seen as a step on the road to \"strong AI\", AI techniques that can functionally do anything humans do. For a long time AI researchers weren\\'t having much luck on go; later, it looked like *if* they solved go, they wouldn\\'t be using techniques that shed much light on how humans are able to play go.  But now, Google claims it has solved the problem *and* has solved it with a technique that could be similar to how humans learn to play Go.\\n\\n3.  It\\'s also exciting because most AI researchers start at the bottom with a weak program trying a new idea and make slow progress, whereas Google kept this quiet until they were ready to smash the competition.\\n\\nJust a note: Fan Hui is a pro, but... if you know tennis, he\\'s a \"club pro\", not the kind of pro who would compete at Wimbledon. He was made a professional a long time ago, but then moved to France, where his main professional Go activities are teaching lessons to amateurs.  He is certainly one of the strongest players in Europe, but I wouldn\\'t compare him to other top professionals.  Google has offered $1 million to Lee Sedol for an exhibition match.  Lee Sedol was best in the world, like, fifteen years ago. If AlphaGo beats Lee Sedol 5-0, it could well be better than any human, but to really clinch the title it would have to beat one of the recent world champions... Historically, chess-playing computers made at least some use of [minimax](_URL_0_).  This relies on \"running through\" some portion of the possible outcomes N turns later.\\n\\nChess has, at any given point, relatively few moves, so it\\'s possible to play at a human level using this approach plus some optimizations -- the computer can \"see\" many turns ahead.\\n\\nThat was not viable for Go, because there was a large \"branching factor\" -- at any given point, there were *many* possible moves, so the number of potential board positions to examine became very large before a computer  using this algorithm could compete with strong human Go players.\\n\\nHumans who play chess (and Go) rely not on brute-force looking down the road, but extracting (somehow) the \"important\" bits of the current board and only caring about those, ignoring irrelevant bits.\\n\\nMost of the problem of artificial intelligence is trying to figure out how to, in a general way, identify what is \"important\" to reaching a goal and what is not efficiently.  One way (probably not necessarily the only way) of building a Go computer would be to create algorithms that can do this -- identifying what is \"important\" and making use of just that information.\\n\\nWhile I think that this Google announcement is interesting, every AI research effort tries to sell its work as being a \"big step\" towards general AI, and I\\'m a lot more cynical.\\n\\nI *am* happy to see research funded towards AI, though. In a game of chess you have a max of 20 move options in the first move. Your opponent also have a max of 20 moves. So their are 400 different combinations of 1st move for both players. for the 2nd move let\\'s assume both players have an average of 20 moves. 20 x 20 is 400 again. 400 X 400 = 1600 possibilities for 2nd move for both players. Obviously the amount of combinations grow.\\n\\nIn Go you have 316 different moves, and your opponent has 315. 316 * 315 = 99,540. The 2nd turn is 314 * 313 = 98,282. So if you take 99,540 * 98,282 = 9,782,990,280. From a pure data point there is far way more options for Go. \\n\\nComputers have been able to figure out chess just by brutal data crunching. You can\\'t do that with Go. Oh dear lord you gotta be frigging kidding me, is this for real?!\\n\\nOh dear lord, I knew this day was coming some day, but they\\'re really challenging Lee Sedol? I\\'m... Oh my god, this is amazing news!!\\n\\nGo is basically The Next Big Game for artificial intelligence. And the fun thing is, I\\'m not sure if after this one, there are any games left for computers to play. Go is essentially a very deep strategy/pattern recognition game where you learn to detect patterns and develop very intricate sense of balance between two forces. Computers have been really helpless against humans in this particular game, simple tree search which bested Chess champions would not do a thing against any decent go player. It called for something smarter than brute force, but nobody could do really anything. Closest algorithmic solution was \"Monte Carlo\", which used very clever method of simulating human intuition by using computer brute force, but even Monte Carlo methods stopped being effective at strong amateur player level. Professionals would easily beat any such computers, and that scenario didn\\'t seem to be changing anytime soon.\\n\\nAnd now all of a sudden we\\'re here. This came as a complete surprise to me, I had no idea. Lee Sedol is a bit of a fading star in a go world, but in the past 15 years, he\\'s been dominant force and many years he\\'s been considered the best human player on the planet. It\\'s close to Garry Kasparov feeling to this game, but if Lee Sedol loses, I think there will still be 1 more match with someone even stronger. I\\'m not really sure who it could be though, but I think go world will know that whoever emerges as the next dominant player, will have the last chance to defend human strength on go board before computers take completely over.\\n\\nBut that\\'s only if Lee Sedol loses. That man is impressive beyond words, I don\\'t know what to expect of the match, other than that it will be epic. [Chess has ~10^120 possible games](_URL_2_). \\n\\n[Go has 10^700 possible games](_URL_2_). \\n\\nMeanwhile, the universe has ~10^80 atoms.\\n\\n\\nThere are simply a lot more potential moves of Go than there are in Chess. Moves that become intuitive for a Go player are not as easy to code. To look forward 3 moves is a lot harder in Go because of the huge number of possibilities of placements, meanwhile chess only has a few set moves that can happen. Go and Chess are examples of games where it pretty simple to learn the rules, but the number of potential states of the board is so large that it is impossible for a computer to calculate all of them. The simplest way to program a computer to play a game like go is to have the computer check every possible combination that fits within the rules and choose the one that provides the best outcome, however, because there are so many possible states of the board, a computer could calculate for centuries and still never calculate every possible state of the board.\\n\\nHumans are really good at pattern recognitions and ignoring situations that are bad choices. For example, a master Go player, with all his experience, knows a lot of things to look for that can greatly narrow down what constitutes a good move from a bad move. Programming a computer to do this is hard, very hard. So hard that it enters the field of machine learning, where the goal is to program a computer to teach itself how to do this. This is still a young and complex field. Google\\'s achievement is a milestone because Go is very hard to teach a computer to play well, but Google has apparently found a way to do it.\\n\\nThe technique Google has used to program Go can be redesigned to work in other applications. Such as autonomous vehicles, weather simulations, and logistics.'),\n",

       "  'Gears control how much force your car can send to the wheels. If you want to accelerate rapidly, you want to be in a lower gear. The downside to low gears is that the engine spins very fast, and so you soon can\\'t make the engine go any faster (like cycling on a bike in a low gear when your legs go round as fast as they can, yet you don\\'t go very fast.)\\n\\nIn order to go at higher speeds, you need to shift into a higher gear. This means the engine can go at a lower speed (RPM) while the car goes at the same speed. Then accelerating speeds the engine back up, which thanks to the higher gear, results in a faster speed for the car.\\n\\nLower gears are better for accelerating, Higher gears are better for having a higher top-speed. Higher gears are also more fuel efficient, since your engine wastes energy the faster it goes. \\n\\nIf you are starting from stationary, you want to be in 1st gear, then as you accelerate to ~10mph you will hear your engine start to whine as the RPM gets high, you should now change up to 2nd gear.\\n\\nConversely if you are doing 70mph on a motorway in 5th gear and slow down to 40pmh make a turning you are now in too high a gear for your speed, and the engine will struggle to accelerate. You should change down to 4th gear as you brake, so your car is ready to accelerate away afterwards.\\n\\nWhen going down a steep hill, you want to change down to a lower gear to keep your car from getting too fast. When going up hill, you also want a lower gear to provide more force to overcome gravity.\\n\\nLower gear - >  more resistance, more acceleration\\nHigher gear - >  less resistance, less acceleration It is something that you will need to learn as it varies by vehicle but here is a good way to get started.\\n\\nStart your car up and let it idle, look at your tachometer (the RPM gauge). The idle RPM is the lowest safe RPM.  There should be a red line displayed near the top of the gauge, this is the maximum safe RPM also referred to as the red line.\\n\\nNow find the half way point between them, for example if you idle at 1000 RPM and redline at 5000 RPM your target shift point will be 3000 rpm.\\n\\nNow start from a stop and accelerate at a medium/slow pace, shift up each time you hit 3000 RPM.  The RPMs will fall back down a bit each time you shift, take note of this.  It will vary a bit depending on gear but it gives you a good idea of where you can start downshifting.  Once you get up to speed you can let off and start coasting, each time you get down to the low point RPM that you noted earlier you can do a downshift, the rpm should pop back up to 3000 RPM when you do this.\\n\\nDo that a few times then start playing with the parameters, run it a little higher before you shift or try shifting a little earlier to see how the RPMs are affected.  As a general rule when you are at a lower RPM you are consuming less fuel, producing less power and putting less stress on the engine.  The opposite is true at a high RPM.  I would try to keep it in that middle range as much as possible, given my example I\\'d recommend staying between 2000 and 4000 RPM until you feel comfortable venturing outside that range. Listen to the engine. When it gets high-pitched and noisy, it\\'s time to shift up a gear. If it starts rumbling and doesn\\'t sound smooth, shift down. These noises will match certain RPMs and you\\'ll get used to what speeds need which gears, but to start with, radio off and use your ears!\\n\\nYou can also feel how the car responds. At the lowest speed the gear can handle, it will feel juddery and jerky, and you could floor the pedal but the car won\\'t respond. In the normal range, it will pull consistently with increased pedal pressure. There\\'s a spot towards the top of that range where it will suddenly pull much harder. And above that, you can floor it but the engine will just be high-pitched and sound rubbish.\\n\\nUse a low gear for hills, and shift down a gear when you need a spurt of speed (e.g. overtaking someone quickly) so that your car is in that burst-of-power zone. Take junctions in second gear. If you have an auto-stick, you do not have to shift - only when you want to.  if you don\\'t feel like it, the automatic transmission does all the work.  \\nI grew up driving manual, and loved it.

There are some states that won\\'t even expunge your record if you are found to have been wrongly convicted. I watched a movie once about a few people who were wrongly convicted then later released because of DNA evidence. One guy was wrongly accused of rape simply because he was wearing the wrong color sweatshirt at the time. 15 years later they got the correct guy and let him out. On record he was still a convicted rapist and had to tell people he was a convicted felon. He was fighting to get his record expunged but it was time consuming and expensive. The guy actually carried his exoneration papers around with him everywhere he went because he was afraid the police would stop him, see that it their system listed him as a convicted rapist and arrest him thinking he had escaped from prison.

       "  'It\\'s sort of the same as asking: how does visible light travel through windows? Every single material has certain wavelengths of light they are allowed to absorb. If this were not true then windows would be completely opaque! So in the same idea, certain materials are unable to absorb radio waves, so these waves can travel right through without much problem since the chemical bonds and atoms don\\'t want to absorb it since they can only allow discrete (specific) values of energy to be absorbed. WiFi waves are just a form of light, just like X-rays, radio waves, microwaves, visible light, and infrared (heat). WiFi falls in the range of large microwave frequencies (2.4 or 5 GHz). \\n\\nLet\\'s look at X-rays as an example: they can pass through your skin, muscles, and other soft tissue, but get absorbed by bones or dense metal. That\\'s how we can get images of your bones using x-rays, but not the other tissue. WiFi waves (radio frequency light) don\\'t get absorbed very easily. Like X-rays, dense and metallic materials absorb them best. Since walls are not very dense, and typically aren\\'t made completely out of metal, the WiFi energy can simply go through without being disturbed. \\n\\nGetting out of ELI5 territory, the ability of a matter to absorb a particular wavelength of light is called \"attenuation\". Attenuation depends on the density of the material, as well as the electronic structure of the material, and varies with changing light frequencies. It also varies depending on the frequency of the light. For examples of WiFi attenuation from common objects, [this table](_URL_1_) highlights the differences between 2.4 and 5 GHz signals. \\n\\n**Sources:**\\n \\n_URL_2_\\n\\n_URL_0_\\n\\nPhD Candidate in Biomedical Engineering Quantumphysics teaches us that electromagnetic waves interact with matter. Visible light is an electromagnetic wave. Light interacts with matter in a \"certain\" way. If there is nothing to interact with is passes through. an examples is glass. You can see through glass. but for example if you have hold a piece of Paper in front of your eyes, you can\\'t see through it. But if somebody is pointing a bright flashlight to your face, you can see the light through the paper. \\n\\nYour WiFi has a certain Wavelength. For this wave length it can interact with matter a completely different way. So for your WiFi-Waves a wall just appears as \"nothing\" as glass does for us. It still interacts and blocks some of the waves but your WiFi is bright enough to still be visible through it. All the explanations I see are way above what you would explain to a five year old, so I\\'ll take a crack at it.\\n\\nStuff, everything from your hand to a chunk of lead is mostly empty space essentially held together by natural forces such as electromagnetism. The particles that make up wifi are very, very tiny and they move in a wave pattern.\\n\\n Those particles are able to travel in the space between the atoms. Now, some do actually crash into the material itself and those don\\'t get to your device. But, if the wave\\'s frequency is high enough, the material\\'s density is low enough and of the right structure, then it can get through and deliver hours and hours of free porn to your device of choice. That\\'s why wifi sometimes has trouble going through multiple walls, the wave diminishes in intensity each time it goes through an obstacle like a wall because it\\'s losing particles do to them crashing into the material. Different points on the electromagnetic spectrum all have a range of wavelengths and frequencies that they reside in.\\n\\nWifi and radio waves are much lower frequency than visible light, and the wavelength is much longer. Every object, no matter how solid, still has empty space in it, due to atomic structuring. Radio waves, with their large, low-frequency waves, are able to slip through this gap.\\n\\n*Edit:* Sorry was half-awake when I responded, fixed some words. ELI5:\\n\\nImagine you have a big net and you try to throw basketballs through it.  The basketballs can\\'t fit through the net\\'s mesh but a baseball probably could and a golf ball definitely could.  \\n\\nThis example is easy to understand, it\\'s a one-way interaction of net and ball.  The smaller the ball, the more likely it will pass through it.  \\n\\nRadio waves, Long Wave, Short Waves, VHF, UHF, Microwaves, WiFi, Infra Red Light, Visible Light, Ultra Violet Light, X-Rays, and Gamma Rays are ultimately the same phenomenon (electromagnetic waves) but with a different frequency / wavelength and they all travel at the speed of light.  The frequency / wavelength of those waves (size of ball) determines whether or not it can pass through matter (the net) without being absorbed (blocked by the net). \\n\\nThis infographic from the 1940s may be helpful in visualizing the electromagnetic spectrum \\n\\n_URL_3_\\n\\nUnfortunately, like most things in reality, the ball and net analogy is a poor explanation.  There\\'s many exceptions where materials will let certain wavelengths through with no problem but impede those with both higher and lower wavelengths. Imagine WiFi as water. Routers with more antennas have more \"water\" than those that don\\'t. Signal strength~quantity of water.\\n\\nWalls (mostly drywall) are like taking that water and pouring it through a paper towel. The water is somewhat soaked up by the towel, but it mostly goes through.

This may be the case, and there may not be any other hidden agenda other than truly to make the U.S. population safer.\\n\\nBut taking away one right, and chipping away at our constitutional freedoms just a little bit every once in awhile, slowly adds up over time. It also allows for more control and more extreme laws to be passed because we the people would simply have no more justification for questioning our government and elected (or maybe in the future, unelected) officials. If there's no laws in place protecting our rights that we enjoy (and take for granted everyday), how could we then argue against things like abuses of power and corruption in the government?

Well, now you have a situation in which the government can record all of your communications and you do not have the right to speak freely.

You can learn more about how volatiles are trapped in magmas [here](_URL_0_). In sedimentary rocks, the pores could be the result of many processes, including expansion or dissolution after the rock has been formed. The important thing to take from this is that for geodes to form, there has to be space in a rock for them to grow.\\n\\nGroundwater has a lot of dissolved constituents: bicarbonate, chloride and sulfate, sodium, calcium, magnesium, potassium, and silica are among the most common. These ions become dissolved in groundwater through a wide range of processes, like interactions with the atmosphere, the surficial environment, soil, and bedrock. \\n\\nGroundwater flows through rocks very slowly (sometimes so slowly that you can hardly tell it\\'s moving), so the water sits in the pores in rocks. Over thousands of years, the chemicals dissolved in the groundwater precipitate out, leaving a silica gel (commonly chalcedony, a strong cryptocrystalline form of quartz) on the interior walls of the pores in the rock. After even more time, distinct crystals begin to form. These can be many minerals, but quartz is by far the most common.\\n\\nGeodes can be found on the surface because quartz is very resistant to erosion.

According to a pamphlet put out by Miner later, his son Tom was the first to use the hook (which was a shepherd\\'s crook prop from an earlier act) to pull a particularly bad amateur performer offstage. Thereafter, it became a regular feature, with crowds shouting \"get the hook\" at unpopular performances. It comes from Vaudeville shows.  Vaudeville shows often had inexperienced performers, \"variety acts\", people who would go way too long, etc.  Nowadays there is a light that signals a performer that   their time is up and to GTFO.  But they didn\\'t have that so they use a big shepherds crook to drag them off the stage.  Cartoons, which became a thing back when vaudeville was popular, ran with this and made it it\\'s own thing.  Vaudeville was kind of like open-mic back in the day. I\\'m a stagehand and occasionally work music festivals.  The stage manager still keeps the schedule and signals to the act when it\\'s time to come off, we just don\\'t use the stick any more.

A more ELI5 answer:\\n\\nImagine the sound from a true cassette tape is a book... or better yet, a scroll.  As you unroll the scroll and read what is written down, that is the same as your audio player reading data to convert into music.  What the converter does is substitute the scroll for a Kindle.  Instead of unrolling the scroll to read it, it simply flashes the data on one single screen for the audio player to read. When I was a kid, I thought I could become a millionaire by taking this idea, then expanding on it to create a VHS cassette which took RCA cables. So you could plug your PlayStation into that shitty old TV at your grandparents that only had the Coaxial connection.

It doesn't have a strong tradition of democracy, tends to lurch towards military dictatorship every now and then and the government doesn't have control over large swathes of the country. What vestiges of democracy it does display are highly questionable as the Pakistani inteligence agency (the ISI) have huge amounts of power and their own agenda.\\n\\n2) These parts of the country that the government has no control over have become a haven for extremists, some of whome are of the Al Qaeda type... essentially these parts are not massively different from what Afghanistan was around 2000.\\n\\n3) It's very important as a supply route to the military operation in Afghanistan. If the Pakistani's stop playing ball, it's essentially game over for the coalition.\\n\\n4) The most important one: Pakistan has nuclear weapons.\\n\\nBasically, the US has to keep Pakistan onside because the alternative is too dangerous to think about: A failed state, riddled with extremists that could potentially access nuclear weapons. Thus, most American efforts are aimed at keeping the genie in the bottle, even if that means randomly killing Pakistani citzens from 20'000 feet via remote control.\\n\\nIs this the right way to go about things? Probably not. Is the alternative any better? Again, probably not. Welcome to the world of realpolitik my little 5 year old chum. First up, I am Indian and so there definitely could be a bias here. But I will try to be as neutral as possible. \\n\\nPakistan has been US' ally since the cold war days (when India, though non-aligned, was more friendly with USSR). Back then, US helped Pakistan build what is today the Taliban. They did that to fight USSR in the now independent Soviet territories like Kazakhstan. \\n\\nSince then, all countries have moved on, but the Taliban remained in Afghanistan; first trying to impose their rule in the country, but after US' war on terror there, they have been away from power, but have been holed up in the tribal areas around South Afghanistan and North Pakistan. These areas are extremely remote and people totally illiterate and they actually align with the Talibani ideas. \\n\\nPakistan has a dual task - that of trying to help US in its fight against these terrorists. However, these tribals in North Pakistan are also a votebank and they cannot be sidelined. Besides that, Pakistan has for long used militancy/terrorism as a proxy state policy to keep India under check in Kashmir and now in the rest of the country as well ([Read this](_URL_1_))\\n\\nConsequently, Pakistan simply cannot disband terrorists at their whim. There are a lot of Talibani sympathisers in the government although the US is claimed the partner since US dollars considerably help the nation moving. \\n\\nSo why can't US simply move out? One, simply because the country also owns up a big part in the whole mess starting with the days of the cold war. So, until they are eliminated (not quite possible without the help of nuclear Pakistan), US may not be able to move out. Two, it is strategic because the US wants to keep its influence on Pakistan alive. If the US moves out today, China will step in. China is considered Pakistan's evergreen friend simply because they have a common enemy in India. So, China will go to any length to keep Pakistani interests alive. ([Read this](_URL_0_)]\\n\\nSo, US moving out will simply make the mess even greater simply because a China-Pakistan combo in an anti-terror fight could be deadly. TBH I have no idea about US politics involving Pakistan (I'm assuming you're American, and I find it presumptuous that you use the term 'we'), but from my limited research and knowledge, I'd say it's because the US government use Pakistan and their intelligence agency (ISI) to help justify the US's occupation of neighbouring countries. There are wikileak documents that indicate the ISI receives funding from the CIA, that gets forwarded to the Taliban in order to keep up the appearance that the US are actually getting attacked by (and fighting against) terrorists.

However, if you're going to be making silk suits, you probably want to have a higher quality product. So rather than having a Bangladesh sweat shop make it, you would have it done by a respected seamstress in Naples.

The red eye doesn't see the blue image and vice versa.\\n\\nThe imax ones make use of something called polarization, which is something many sunglasses have. Essentially it makes it so that only light that is oriented a particular direction can make it through the glasses. The left eye takes the up and down light, and the right eye the side to side light. This allows you to see two separate images without screwing the color Red and blue glasses filter particular wave lengths and it's easy to create compatible image as it pretty much requires your screen to be able to produce color.\\n\\nIMAX is polarizing light, that is if the light emitted by screen is not aligned with screen on individual glass, it won't come through. This requires specialized screens to produce properly polarized light.\\n\\nThe third variant is active, switching glasses. These are instructed by TV that knows which eye it is producing image for. So you see left-right-left-right images in sequence and glasses are blocking view of the image if it's not made to be seen by a given eye. Red and blue 3D glasses filter out red and blue light. To get a 3D effect, two versions of a black and white image are projected- one tinted red, one tinted blue. The glasses each block out one image, so each I sees something slightly different. It works, but you can’t use it for color-footage.\\n\\nModern 3D glasses used polarizing filters. Basically, since light moves in waves, if you project it through tiny vertical or horizontal slits, you end up with light that is only moving vertically or horizontally. In 3D glasses, one eye has a polarizing filter turned horizontally, and one has a filter turned vertically. Same thing with the two projectors projecting the film.

       "  'There are three states that the world can be in:\\n\\n*One superpower*\\n\\n*Multiple superpowers*\\n\\n*No super powers (every country equally as strong as another)*\\n\\nLets start with the last one. By nature, countries will compete for dominance over one another for political, economic, and security reasons. Therefore this state is almost unattainable. Not all countries can afford or care to keep up with the others, so there will never be a time when no country is more powerful than others. \\n\\nNow for the middle state, *multiple superpowers*. This is what the cold war was. This ends up the same as we discussed above, because the countries that CAN afford to compete for power DO compete, and end up in \\'cold\\' wars with one another. This can happen with any number of countries, for instance during the last half of the 20th century it was two (US and USSR), but it could easily happen with three, four, or more countries competing for dominance.\\n\\nFirst on this list is close to what we have now, *one superpower*. The united states \\'won\\' the cold war because the other guy quit competing. That left it with no other country even CLOSE to being as powerful militarily or spending as much as they did. \\n\\nHere they had two options: stop spending because our main threat is \\'gone\\', or keep spending to PREVENT them from being able to come back. The US chose the latter, obviously. Many people think that a system of one superpower is the most realistic \\'best\\' option. It is unrealistic to think that countries will not compete with each other, and a cold war is dangerous for the entire planet because nuclear arms exist. \\n\\nThe theory is this: If the US spends so much money and has such a large military presence in most of the world that they can counter any emerging threats before they get too big, that *theoretically* means that other countries would have a hard time becoming powerful enough to inflict major harm on other countries because the US *could* swoop in at any time and stop them. While the US is not a perfect country, most of the world (the west and some of Asia) thinks that the US is a good choice because *the other candidates are worse*. Russia? Most of the world doesn\\'t want them to have the power. China? Same thing. Both have terrible human rights records and less obligation to do things fairly because they don\\'t answer to their citizens in the same way. While the US doesn\\'t do things fairly or always do the \\'right\\' thing, it\\'s pretty much the only candidate for the job that has a *chance* of doing the right thing. \\n\\nAncillary reasons: With the US military being so large and powerful, many Europeans countries can spend WAY less money per capita on their military. This is good for them. Part of the reason the US spends more than the next 13 countries combined is because they hardly spend anything at all since they either can\\'t keep up enough to matter against the US military or they are friends with the US.\\n\\nThe US spends a lot but we have for all of recent memory so the citizens don\\'t put up much fuss. It also helps that having the most powerful military in the world allows you to exert your will on other countries for political, economic, or security reasons. The base of it is this: it is politically unpopular to reduce the size of the military for any reason. There is a big enough military-industrial complex that you would essentially be removing jobs from the US economy, and so nobody wants to do it. When you add to that that you\\'re essentially firing our most patriotically-viewed demographic, it\\'s almost political suicide.\\n\\nEisenhower, a 5-star general in the military during WWII, talked on his way out of the presidency about how [dangerous it is to the US to let the military-industrial complex](_URL_1_) get out of hand, but even an insider who was president at the time couldn\\'t stop its growth.\\n\\nClearly, a military is important, but outspending the [next 13 closest militaries](_URL_0_) is, in my opinion, just as clearly too big. It depends on your definition of \"need.\" For better or worse the USA is the leading world power at the moment, to maintain this status we actually do \"need\" the military we have (there is a reason China is building up their military), Europe\\'s military spending is tiny in comparison and rely heavily on the USA for the bulk of NATO work (US missile defense systems in Turkey, US tank busters in Germany, US Navy controlling Atlantic  &  Mediterranean, etc.), the US controls the ocean\\'s trading routes all over the entire planet (US Navy has the 2nd largest air force in the world after the US Air Force) which allows for trade to continue is some of the most hostile environments (see coast of Somalia), the US acts as world police as well basically being involved in some way in every conflict in the globe and spends billions giving money to foreign countries to help maintain relative peace. Domestically, u/praecipula explained it well, too much money involved in making sure things don\\'t change. You could say this is a bad thing, but even as someone who thinks we spend far too on our military, I would prefer for the US to be doing this than any other country as there are few who can actually fund such activities, history has shown someone will always step into that power vacuum if you step away (every empire throughout history, more recently Spain then Britain, now us), and the other options (really just Russia  &  China) seem like they would do a lot worse of a job. The U.S. Is in a position of power. If it was to drastically reduce its military strength it\\'s not like the rest of the world will stay the same. The power vacuum would be filled by Russia or China. As much as many people disagree with how the United States handles its foreign policy, you can be certain a Russia or China as the sole superpower would be much, much worse. Not a full answer, but kind of a response to the people who state that U.S. military is bigger than \"next 13 closest militaries\". The size difference is simply because a lot of the rest of the world (especially Europe) relies heavily on U.S. defense spending, therefore those governments have a lesser need to invest in defense themselves. A huge portion of NATO is funded by the US. For the amount of money it spends the US actually has a relatively small military. But it has a very well equipped military. \\n\\nIt also has a massive air and sea component. The US would rather use that technological edge to leverage force, meaning that they need fewer ground forces to accomplish the same goal in theory.\\n\\nThe US is also separated by oceans from most politically or geographically important areas. meaning that the ability to get there, protect lines of communication, and keep supplied are very important, in addition to power projection. hence the need for a large air force and navy. Both of those get very expensive as they require constant upgrades and maintenance, and training. The reason the US military is so large is so it can win on multiple fronts while still defending the homeland. Consider that perspective when you read stats about how the US military is larger than several others combined. Winning a foreign conflict doesn\\'t help if it leaves you venerable. \\n\\nFrom _URL_2_\\nThe current strategic doctrine, which Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld issued in his Quadrennial Defense Review of early 2001 (before the 9/11 attacks), is a package of U.S. military requirements known as 1-4-2-1. The first 1 refers to defending the US homeland. The 4 refers to deterring hostilities in four key regions of the world. The 2 means the US armed forces must have the strength to win swiftly in two near-simultaneous conflicts in those regions. The final 1 means that the US forces must win one of those conflicts \"decisively\". Whether it\\'s cars, crops, computers, financial services, fossil fuels or t-shirts, every country has its exports.  The US exports its military.  The difference is that while other goods are paid for with money, having a large military is paid for by having a deeper influence in foreign affairs.  This helps put US friendly leaders in charge who may seek to increase trade with the US.  We protect them, or economy grows.  You could try to reduce the size of the military, but ultimately it\\'s a big advantage to have  a larger, more disciplined military than anyone else.  You don\\'t want to let someone take that away from you.'),\n",

       "  'It\\'s sort of like rugby, except the players line up before each play and there are stricter rules about contact.\\n\\nEach team gets four tries, or \\'downs\\' to move the ball as far as possible down the field. They can do this by handing the ball to a fast player,  the \\'running back\\', or by throwing it to a receiver down the field. The thrower is called the quarterback. A down is over when the player currently holding the ball is tackled. If the team can move forward ten yards in four downs, the counter for downs starts over.  \\n\\nOne touchdown (moving the ball to the other end of the field) is worth 6 points. After that , the team can either kick the ball through the upright goal to gain another point, or try to run the ball past the other team for another two points. \\n\\nAfter 4 downs or a touchdown, the ball is given to the other team for their attempt at a goal. 2 teams each have a goal of getting the ball to one side of the field (the endzone). They take turns, going 1 \\'play\\' at a time, to get the ball down the field. During a play, the quarterback (the one who is first given the ball when everyone starts moving) can run with the ball on his own, throw the ball, hand the ball off for someone else to run, etc. All of these are different types of plays. There are hundreds of plays that various teams use, with their own twists on them, etc. \\n\\n\\nIn order to get down the field, a team has 4 \\'plays\\', also called \\'downs\\', to get there. However, if the team is able to gain 10 yards in 1-4 downs, they gain 4 more turns (get their counter reset to \\'1st down\\'). The ball is always placed at where it was held when the person holding the ball was tackled (basically). So if the quarterback runs for 5 yards and is tackled on their 1st down, when they start up again it\\'s now 2nd down, with 5 yards remaining, or as it\\'s commonly referred to, \"2^nd and 5\". If the quarterback was tackled behind their original 10 yards, they have to make up those extra yards too. \\n\\nWhen a team reaches the endzone, that\\'s called a touchdown. This grants 6 points. The team then has the option of either kicking the ball through the posts for 1 extra point (which happens a lot because it\\'s relatively easy) or running another play from the 10(right?) yard line. if during that extra play they get into the endzone again, they get 2 points. \\n\\nIf a team is close enough to the endzone but doesn\\'t want to risk running a play on a 4th down (a lot of teams won\\'t because if they don\\'t make it, the ball is given to the other team), they\\'ll try to go for a field goal, which is where the offense has a kicker that tries to kick the ball from whereever it is into the slot between the 2 posts. This is worth 3 points.\\n\\nIf a team is on 4th down but they\\'re too far away for a field goal, they will often (but don\\'t HAVE to) punt. In this case, a kicker kicks the ball as far down field as he can (without kicking it out of bounds) in order to make the other team, who is now on offense, have to go as far as possible to gain their points.\\n\\nThere\\'s a few other more advanced rules, but those are the basics I wish someone had told me when I started watching.

I\\'ve found that trying to explain the game to my female friends while we\\'re *not* watching the game is a lot like trying to describe to someone how to ride a bicycle: it really works a million times better if you just learn as you go.\\n\\nHope you can figure it out enough to enjoy it; football is a wonderful sport because it offers hard hits and great speed for the casual fans, but also has really complex and cerebral strategy for more in-depth fans.  Good luck! A friend of mine explained american football like this to me one day: \"Football is gaining land by force while wearing fabulously tight pants\" Football is like war.\\n\\nYou have 2 sides. We\\'ll call one side the British and the other side the Scotts. The Scotts are trying to get a special \"package\" behind the British line. Keep in mind, there are special rules of war, but the basic concept is that each side will try to guess how the other side will line up the troops. The Scotts are trying to line up their troops to exploit weaknesses in the British defense and the British are trying set up defense that will effectively counter the Scotts\\' offensive. If the Scotts successfully get the package across the British lines, then they get 6 points. They can then try to kick the package through the enemy headquarters window for an additional point.\\n\\nNow the Scotts have 4 attempts to move the package 10 yards. If by the 3rd attempt there is no chance to move the package the requisite distance, then they have a choice. If they are close enough, they can attempt to kick the package through the window for only 3 points. If they are too far, then they want to kick the package as far back to the enemy line as possible where the British can then pick the package up and attempt to do the same to the Scotts.\\n\\nThere are a few additional things...but that\\'s the basic concept.

A single one or zero is a bit, and 8 of these put together (at least in most modern computers) is a byte. But brains don\\'t work like that at all. We store memories as connections between nerve cells, so bytes is not a very applicable unit to measure brain capacity with. A more accurate measure of brain capacity is the number of connections in the brain. Most computer scientists would say yes. The brain occupies a finite amount of space and since the universe is discrete, there is a finite amount of information in there. Personally, I\\'m not too comfortable with the number of assumptions being made with that logic, but my position on that matter is controversial.\\n\\nI do know that to say the brain\\'s storage reduces to the number of neuron connections is probably not correct. It\\'s far more complex than that. There is also a dynamic electro-chemical state between and within the synapses which has some information storage capacity--various ion and neurotransmitter concentrations, for instance. Things like \"are you happy\" probably aren\\'t stored in a chart showing which neuron is connected to which other. You can take a pill to change that variable.\\n\\nThen, unlike a regular computer, the brain and the body has evolved an extremely integrated interface with its environment such that it\\'s often difficult to tell where you draw the line between brain and not-brain. For instance, what about your body temperature? It effects cognition, and is in a feedback path with the brain. Could that be considered a form of storage? There are many examples like that.\\n\\nIt\\'s often forgotten that information is specific to context. A forgotten language can only be deciphered if we actually share something with the lost civilization-- feelings, biology, environment.  The brain is weird because it creates its own context.\\n\\nSince the brain is so closely integrated with its environment, its identity can become blurred and it can become unclear *where* the brain actually is. Your brain organized your room and now your room effects your cognition. Is your room information storage? You have a romantic partner. Your brain interacts with them and changes them. Now they interact with you and change your cognition. Are they storage? The [transactive memory hypothesis] (_URL_0_) builds on this idea and suggests there are memories that we can only have or have better when we\\'re together with someone we\\'ve interacted with before.\\n\\nYou could say that these external sources are just external and thus we can ignore them. But your environment, which your brain is changing, effects you whether or not you ask for it. In that way, the external is really not so external. Your environment is not like a USB flash drive. You can\\'t unplug it. There are numerous examples of what happens when you try to unplug it. Extreme isolation for example. The brain just breaks down in these contexts.  So environment is actually part of you.\\n\\nIf the brain doesn\\'t have well-defined limits, then measuring its capacity is going to be incredibly difficult. It could still be a number in bytes depending on which physics you subscribe to. It\\'s commonly believed that the whole universe has a finite storage capacity. If so, then even a brain without a skull limit still has a universe limit. Yes, our memory can hold anywhere from 1 to 100 terabytes. Combined with strong neurons (our processors) that could make our storage up to 2.5 petabytes. This of course varies per person . i think this is a bad comparison. our brain seems to plot experiences into the neuronal network and thereby is able to see similarities to a previous experience. thus, we have no \"storage\" and \"processing\". the overall activity at one moment is the information experienced.\\n\\ntechnically, the brain is non-binary (it does not store bits and bytes), it measures time between activities (neuronal firing) which is a complex number, and quantifies this information (threshold levels for input triggering activity from the cell); it can multitask and consider various levels of analysis at the same time -- this allows it to be fuzzy and very apt at pattern matching.\\n\\nwhen you count how much a person can learn, you get bytes, but this is really not the good way to see the brain. it does not store things in this way. the more you learn from one thing, the easier is the storage for still more, and so on.'),\n",

       "  'Nuclear warheads fitted to ICBM\\'s and SLBM\\'s are not really warheads in the same sense as an artillery round. They are in fact a small and complex machine fitted inside a heat resistant and aerodynamic shell. It might be easier to think of them as miniature spacecraft. One nuclear missile will carry several warheads and they will seperate to attack different targets or the same target multiple times. These are called MIRV or Multiple Independent Re-Entry Vehicle.\\n\\nBecause they are basically machines, they are designed to be taken apart and maintained. The pit or the nuclear element of the warhead is just one component. It can be removed and in fact very often is removed from the warhead for things like testing (Where it is replaced by an inert device) and routine maintenance.\\n\\nThe decommissioning process varies depending on the terms of the treaty. In some cases it is simply a case of reducing the number of MIRV\\'s the missile carries say from 12 to 8. If physical removal is required it is a case of removing the nuclear element of the warhead and putting it into storage or use as a fuel, while recycling or destroying the components of the MIRV. The missiles themselves are rarely destroyed in entirety, they or their components often have useful secondary peaceful applications.\\n\\nThere are a number of common misconceptions about ICBM\\'s, SLBM\\'s and nuclear warheads and their MIRV delivery system. One is that their guidance components use GPS to guide them into their targets. This is in fact not true. These missiles must reach their target and relying on GPS might harm their chances of that happening if the GPS system where to be attacked. So the majority of ICBM/SLBM use celestial navigation (The positions of the stars) to guide them into their targets. They don\\'t have to be super accurate. A circular error of probability of half a mile is acceptable. Russian missiles used to have massive payloads to make up for their less accurate guidance systems. It really doesn\\'t matter if your off target by 3 miles if you ramp up the explosive power by 10 megatons! For this reason you will often see US missiles use smaller warheads than their russian counterparts.\\n\\nAnother common misconception is that the warheads have some communication component that offers an ability to communicate with it after launch and give a recall or cancellation ability, so if a missile is fired in some sort of accidental launch scenario it can be communicated with and made inert or to blow itself up without going nuclear. This is also not true and is a myth perpetrated by Hollywood. The risks of an enemy finding out how to communicate with the missile and destroy it would be too great. These weapons are designed to be the ultimate and last deterrent. The missile, once fired, communicates with nothing and no-one. It is a self contained system that once the button has been pressed, will carry out it\\'s mission to it\\'s final horrifying end unless it is somehow intercepted externally.\\n\\n---\\n\\nEDIT: Clarified decommissioning process and celestial navigation and the fact I may not have mentioned inertial guidance clearly enough. To clarify the correct term is astro-inertial guidance in that the \"majority\" of ICBM\\'s and SLBM\\'s (Lest we not forget the US developed versions are not the only types of these horrific weapons) use both, with inertial guidance being responsible for initial and re-entry guidance and celestial for mid course correction. \\n\\nSo celestial navigation is the tracking of your position by looking at where you are in relation to the stars, because where you are and the time of day defines what you can see and where they should be in the night sky. It\\'s not an overly complex skill and we have been doing it for a very long time. It\\'s kind of fallen out of use in these days of GPS. Ships at sea would use a sextant to help them plot their position relative to the time of the day and the position of the stars which was why getting accurate clocks on board ships was such a big deal many years ago. In fact the earliest Boeing 747 aircraft had a porthole in their cockpit roofs to allow the crew to use celestial navigation should the need arise!\\n\\nObviously celestial navigation is of more use at night and in good weather if your on the ground, but ICBM\\'s and SLBM\\'s don\\'t need to worry about this as within the space of about 30 seconds they are high enough to begin using it without either of these concerns as they use inertial guidance in their initial launch. The missile and MIRV\\'s basically have a digital version of a sextant on board. If you would like to see a vaguely similar approximation of how they work, I suggest you download the [Sky app \\\\(Formerly Google Sky\\\\)](_URL_0_), which allows you to use your phone to plot the stars in the sky (Though Google augments this with GPS data so they cheat a little bit). Simplifying what others have said;\\n\\n1) remove component warhead parts and break down further. The radioactive material is often reprocessed into the nuclear power industry.\\n\\n2) remove fuel component from missile. Liquid fuelled missiles are typically only fuelled just prior to launch. Solid fuel missiles are a little more complicated. Rocket fuel can be rather toxic depending upon the type.\\n\\n3) missile body is then often cut up and left exposed to satellite observation, or observers from the opposite side of the treaty are there watching the destruction processes. Sometimes both.\\n\\n4) the silos/ mobile launchers can also be destroyed depending upon the treaty. Observers  &  satellites monitor this.\\n\\nWhen Kazakhstan became nuclear free the US and Russians were present on the ground. The warheads went back to Russia and monitored into the nuclear fuel industry. The silos were systemically destroyed, with additional work undertaken every ~6 months. I have photos of several of the Kazak silos going through phased destruction back in the mid to late \\'90\\'s. Nuclear weapons were designed to be maintained (fixed).  So most of the device is taken apart.  The one thing that was not really designed to be fixed is the \"pit\" made of dangerously radioactive material and high explosive sometimes literally glued to the pit.  You can use cold to make the explosive brittle and crack it off or use solvents to dissolve it over time.  Once you have the pit, you can recycle it to other nuclear devices or mix it with lower quality material and use it in nuclear reactors. There are really two issues here. One is the dismantling — taking things apart. The other is verification — proving to the other party or parties that you did really take things apart, and aren\\'t just lying about it. The latter is just as important for treaties as the former.\\n\\nAs for taking them apart, it is neither as easy nor as hard as one might imagine. Nuclear warheads, and nuclear missiles, and nuclear silos, are all just complex machines. They have many parts. They were not built with the intention of making it easy to take them apart (it isn\\'t just a matter of using a screwdriver), but you can take them apart. Nuclear warheads are disassembled in \"[gravel gertie](_URL_3_)\" containment bays that make it so that if something goes seriously wrong — e.g., their high explosives detonate — contamination will be limited (gravel will collapse onto it, holding in any scattered plutonium, etc.). The missiles themselves can be de-fueled and then disassembled in pieces. It isn\\'t significantly different than deconstructing any other device that contains some dangerous or toxic parts. The warhead is probably the most difficult thing to take apart because it contains toxic, radioactive, and volatile (explosive) components, but they develop procedures for doing it and have been doing it for years.\\n\\nOK, so how do you verify that you\\'ve done it? Most treaties focus only on the disassembly of delivery vehicles, e.g., the planes, missiles, or submarines. Proving you took those apart is relatively straightforward: they are large enough to be seen by satellites so you can just destroy the thing in question in a relatively \"public way.\" For airplanes this is particularly striking: the [\"boneyards\"](_URL_3_) of retired planes, which are just rusting outside, some of which have been \"guillotined\" with massive blades. Submarines can be taken apart in dry dock, silos can be decommissioned and destroyed, etc. Each \"side\" has people whose job it is to count up such activities, and so you can get a pretty good tally of what each side has or hasn\\'t. In a world of ubiquitous satellite coverage, you just don\\'t have states being able to field large numbers of ICBMs or even submarines without it being noticed.\\n\\nNone of the treaties currently limit the number of total warheads in a stockpile (they limit the number of _deployed_ warheads which is more a question of delivery vehicles than actual warheads). The question of \"counting warheads\" actually presents really tricky technical aspects that have been recognized for some time. The US and Russia are not willing to share information on how their warheads work with one another. If they were, it would just be a matter of disassembling the warhead while someone else watched. Because they want to keep it secret, all sorts of counting problems are involved. Let\\'s say I am monitoring Russian warhead dismantlement. They show me a box and say, \"there\\'s a warhead in there.\" They take it inside their dismantlement facility, then say they took it apart. They might show me another set of boxes and say, \"here are the parts from that warhead.\" How do I know that any of that is true? How do I know the box isn\\'t just filled with lead? How do I know they haven\\'t just squirreled the warhead out the back of the facility? \\n\\nThere aren\\'t easy answers here. There are some interesting technical approaches to being able to verify that the box contains a warhead without learning anything about the warhead\\'s design. [You can read about some of them here if you are interested in more details](_URL_3_), but they are essentially similar to creating a \"one-way hash\" of a 3D, physical object, e.g., something that lets you verify it is \"X\" without being able to see what the \"X\" actually is on the inside. \\n\\nIt is not clear we will ever have treaties that put firm limits on warhead counts, it is not clear it is even necessary (if you can\\'t deliver the warhead, who cares?), but the work is being done under the assumption that maybe, someday, there will be political will to do such a thing, and if that day comes, it would be nice to have worked out all of the technical aspects ahead of time, so they don\\'t become a stumbling block. The biggest component of disarming a nuke is realizing that they\\'re damn near impossible to set off. A nuclear explosion requires very precise timing of reactions to take place. There\\'s disarming the missile, which is removing the solid rocket fuel and recycling the aluminum skin.\\n\\nThen there\\'s disassembly of the warhead. As others point out, that is done by separating the electronics package from the high explosive (which is burned) and taking out the nuclear pit. It would be stored, or mixed with lower concentration U-238.\\n\\nThe US does all warhead disassembly at the Pantex plant near Amarillo. Fissile material is stored at Y-12 in Oak Ridge.\\n\\n_URL_4_ A small departure here...\\n\\nMaintenance is a serious business.  For those not familiar with the accident in Damascus, AK in 1980 you should check out the PBS documentary that shows how a dropped socket caused a fire and eventual explosion that ejected a 9 megaton nuclear package.\\n\\n_URL_5_ Making it very short, they\\'re handled in two ways:\\n\\nFirst, the warheads are removed and stored at Kirtland AFB in New Mexico. Specifically, in [this massive bunker.](_URL_7_) Fun fact: they\\'re not really dismantled for the most part, they just sit in cold storage under observation.\\n\\nNext, the delivery system (missile, bomb, cruise missile, airplane, etc.) are destroyed in a way that makes them impossible to reuse. Airplanes get cut in half — like [these ones](_URL_6_), in Arizona. Missile launch positions get blown up or filled with concrete.\\n\\nFinally, the warheads are trucked to Texas. Disassembly occurs in a plant there. Once the batteries are disconnected, a nuclear weapon is basically impossible to set off, and becomes much easier to disassemble. The conventional explosives are separated from the nuclear components. Most of the parts are simply stored separately, as they\\'re specialized enough to be incredibly useful to say, a rogue state looking for more information on how to construct a weapon.'),\n",

       "  \"Your genetic material is organized into pairs of chromosomes. The two chromosomes in a pair are not the same. You have one from your mother and one from your father.\\n\\nNow, scattered around in your chromosomes are some damaged genes that don't work properly. Mostly this is fine because for every damaged gene on a chromosome, it's very likely that there is a good gene on the other chromosome that will do the job, so it's usually not a problem unless both genes are damaged.\\n\\nSince most people don't have very many damaged genes, if you just pick two people at random (a mom and a dad) it's very likely that whatever damaged genes one of them has, they will be fine in the other. So no problem.\\n\\nHowever, damaged genes are still passed on to your children. Say you have a daughter Y. Half of her chromosomes come from you. Now you make another kid (X) with your daughter (ew). X now has half his chromosomes from you, and the other half from his mother, who is Y, but she has half of *her* chromosomes from you, so about half of X's chromosomes from Y are actually yours, too.\\n\\nAll of a sudden it becomes much more likely that X has at least one pair of identical chromosomes. And that's bad, because it means that damaged genes on one of the chromosomes are also damaged on the other.\\n\\nSo inbreeding actually increases the probability that *problems that are already there* will become apparent. If you don't have any damaged genes, inbreeding is fine. (Actually there are other problems too, but they are not as critical.)\\n\\nSo when you isolate a bunch of people and they have to start inbreeding (because there simply aren't enough), there will be problems for a while until evolution can clean up the genetic pool.

       "  'Keep in mind that much of the security on aircraft is a result of 9/11.  It would be common for passengers (typically small children) to get to go and look around the cockpit during a flight; there were no heavy locking doors.  Security was significantly more relaxed, so bringing small weapons less difficult than with the modern TSA (which itself does a fairly poor job at screening, but that\\'s another rant).\\n\\nOn top of that you have the precedent set by previous hijackings where the hijackers wanted the plane as a means of transportation or wanted the passengers as hostages.  9/11 was so jarring to the world because the hijackers wanted the planes themselves to be used as weapons.\\n\\nOn 9/11 the U.S. was at peace.  We didn\\'t have armed planes sitting all over the place to quickly intercept any plane that gets out of line.  However, when the reality of 9/11 became clear we *did* scramble fighters.  [This](_URL_0_) article is about an F-16 pilot who was ordered into the air to intercept Flight 93 which was ultimately downed in Pennsylvania.  The aircraft had no weapons loaded on board; it was a suicide mission to physically strike the Boeing 757 with her plane to knock it out of the sky.\\n\\nThe article is a good read.  It sheds some light onto the pre-9/11 atmosphere in the United States. In the history of hijacking ,  the hijackers always held the passengers at bay for some ransom.  Freed prisoner, public statement, etc.   Then fly to some agreed safe airport and they\\'d release the passengers.      the goal before 9/11 was to protect the passengers onboard.     No one thought they didn\\'t care about the passengers but were wanting the plane itself.\\n\\nBesides. Manhattan isn\\'t restricted nofly space.  You can take helicopter rides of Manhattan.    The corridor along manhannttan is vfr airspace Here\\'s a link to the [airspace](_URL_2_) around NYC. Take a moment to look at it.\\n\\nThe region inside the blue lines is the NYC controlled airspace (technically, we call it \"Class B\"). It\\'s not \"restricted\" in the sense that you\\'re not allowed to fly there. They only serve as a regulatory zone — that is, you need permission from Air Traffic Control to enter the zone. And in fact, you can fly above or below it without permission all you want. You don\\'t even have to have your radio on or be on a flight plan.\\n\\nThere are three major airports in the zone and a fair number of minor ones. It just wouldn\\'t be practical to ban airplanes from that area. And even if you knew there was a rogue airplane coming in to do mischief, there aren\\'t any military bases nearby to get fighters in the air, and if there are any anti-aircraft batteries in the area, I\\'ve never heard about it. And finally, as other posters have pointed out, nothing like 9/11 had ever happened before and we were at peace, so there was no reason to think that incoming planes needed to be stopped.\\n\\nNow look at [Washington, DC](_URL_2_) by contrast. The heavy dashed circle around the area is an Air Defense Identification Zone. You need a clearance to enter this and you have to obtain it in advance. There\\'s a very good chance that you *will* be intercepted by fighters if you come in without permission. It used to be that the only ADIZs were out over the ocean to guard against aircraft coming in from overseas without permission, but since 9/11 we\\'ve had one over Washington as well.\\n\\nFor good measure, the red circles are Temporary Flight Restrictions, which are thrown up for special occasions such as airshows or VIP visits. However, the big one over Washington isn\\'t so temporary.\\n\\nEven now, this stuff isn\\'t enforced *that* heavily. Some years ago, I saw a guy who flew through the TFR over G.W.Bush\\'s home in Texas while he was in residence. He was intercepted by fighters and ordered to land, and then the police came and took him out of his plane and took him to the station to be questioned. He wasn\\'t shot down, and in fact after he convinced the police that it was an accident, they just let him go.\\n\\nEdit: heh. Looking at the NYC airspace today (15 Sep 2016) I see the whole thing is a TFR (scheduled to start in 3 days). Wasn\\'t there when I made this post. Will probably be gone a week from now. The amount of time the planes were actually flying over Manhattan was maybe 30 seconds for the first plane and zero seconds for the second (the towers are right on the water and the second plane came from New York Harbor). Not enough time to shoot them down. \\n\\nPlus civilian airliners had never been weaponized before, so shooting down a civilian airliner that could simply have drifted into restricted airspace would be an unlikely response. There were quite a few notable incidents during the Cold War where a civilian plane was shot down for accidentally violating airspace. The communication on 9/11 was not great. By the time the military was notified of a hijacking it was way to late. At the speed an airplane travels, it entered restricted airspace less than 30 seconds before it hit the towers. Also as others have mentioned, the history of airline hijackings had entirely been for ransom or political purposes. To my knowledge no hijacker had ever handled the controls of an airplane, let alone used it as a missile. The government was preparing itself for a hostage situation, not a missile attack on a skyscraper. Even if you could reliably shoot down two passenger jets in time, you\\'re basically condemning all the passengers aboard to death. That they were doomed anyway was unknown at the time: nobody had ever hijacked planes to use as flying bombs before. Everyone expected that the planes would be flown to, say, Havana, demands made, possibly a few hostages shot, but eventually most of the passengers would be set free one way or another and have a thrilling story to tell the grandkids.\\n\\nIn any case, shooting down a passenger airliner (or anything, really) over Manhattan is hardly a good idea: you\\'d end up killing an awful lot of people on the ground as well. Perhaps not as many as were, in the event, actually killed, but right up until the first plane hit, nobody had the faintest idea what the hijackers were up to.\\n\\nAir traffic control couldn\\'t do anything. Well, they can refuse the pilots permission to fly into a certain area, but we\\'re talking terrorists on a suicide mission: they\\'re hardly going to break off their attack just because somebody is shouting at them over the radio.\\n\\nThe hijackers were able to enter the flight deck (btw, you shouldn\\'t refer to it as the \"cockpit\": only fighter planes have cockpits, passenger airliners have flight decks) because before 9/11, the flight deck doors were not normally locked. It was 9/11 that actually changed that: so the hijackers didn\\'t have to \"break in\", they just had to barge in with their box cutters -- in the days when security screening wasn\\'t nearly as rigorous as it is now (again, it was 9/11 that changed things).\\n\\nIn short, the reason the US was unprepared for such an attack was quite simply that nobody had ever attempted to carry out such an attack before, and nobody had ever seriously thought for one moment that terrorists might actually hijack a plane and deliberately fly it into a building. Your thoughts on our security are pretty much wrong.\\n\\nIt isnt an immediate response to send fighter jets to a commercial airliner.  What happened on 9/11 had never happened before and we just werent prepared for it.  I mean these people did it with box cutters and shit.  We don\\'t have defensive AA batteries sitting around in cities waiting to protect us from incoming missiles and run away planes.  In all honesty if our land bases were ever struck we would be pretty much sitting ducks. As others have mentioned, people never thought this would have happened. Here\\'s a few things of note as well:\\n\\n*How were air traffic controllers not able to detect/prevent this?* Air traffic controllers were able to quickly determine the planes were hijacked. The planes stopped following the direction of ATC, and started going maverick. Initially, Boston Center controllers notified surrounding centers, including New York. But, the hijackers stopped the transponder code for the planes, so controllers were looking at just a blip with no information on their screen. They notified the military, but, military controllers were looking at literally hundreds of blips on their screens, so it was tough to sort out what was the hijacked planes. Also, by the time the military was advised of the hijackings, the most warning time they had was six minutes.\\n\\n*Wouldn\\'t there by military planes ready to deploy?* Yes, there were. Northeast Air Defense Sector (NEADS) had two bases to deploy air defense jets (Otis in Massachusetts and Langley in Virginia). As soon as the report of the two planes from Boston being hijacked came in, they put the jets on \"battle stations\" (which is putting the pilots in the cockpits) and then \"scrambled\" (getting them in the air) within minutes. However, they had no idea the targets of the planes, so it took a little bit for the military to plot a course for the pilots. After the two planes hit the towers, the Major in charge of NEADS put the jets over Manhattan. As far as Washington DC, a military C-130 actually watched the hijacked plane crash into the Pentagon. But, the military only had two minutes warning to scramble the jets from Virginia, which takes 15 minutes flight time. The military also wasn\\'t notified about Flight 93 until much later, and they had scrambled jets that were out on a training mission, and unarmed, to fly into the area, and if necessary, to ram the plane.\\n\\nAnother note of interest is that even IF they had planes in the area, they weren\\'t authorized to shoot down hijacked planes until ordered to do so. The order eventually came down from the Vice President, but there was a delay due to the Secretary of Defense helping evacuate victims from the Pentagon. In fact, it was noted he was unreachable for 25 minutes.  \\n\\n(If you have time to kill: _URL_3_) [From Popular Mechanics:](_URL_4_)\\n\\n > On 9/11 there were only 14 fighter jets on alert in the contiguous 48 states. No computer network or alarm automatically alerted the North American Air Defense Command (NORAD) of missing planes. \"They [civilian Air Traffic Control, or ATC] had to pick up the phone and literally dial us,\" says Maj. Douglas Martin, public affairs officer for NORAD. Boston Center, one of 22 Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) regional ATC facilities, called NORAD\\'s Northeast Air Defense Sector (NEADS) three times: at 8:37 am EST to inform NEADS that Flight 11 was hijacked; at 9:21 am to inform the agency, mistakenly, that Flight 11 was headed for Washington (the plane had hit the North Tower 35 minutes earlier); and at 9:41 am to (erroneously) identify Delta Air Lines Flight 1989 from Boston as a possible hijacking. The New York ATC called NEADS at 9:03 am to report that United Flight 175 had been hijacked—the same time the plane slammed into the South Tower. Within minutes of that first call from Boston Center, NEADS scrambled two F-15s from Otis Air Force Base in Falmouth, Mass., and three F-16s from Langley Air National Guard Base in Hampton, Va. None of the fighters got anywhere near the pirated planes. Easy to second guess the decisions with hindsight. At the time a terrorist attack on this scale was not on anyone\\'s mind. At the time the assumption was mechanical or pilot error. By the time they realized there was a problem it was too late to shoot it down. Shoot them down with what exactly?

       " ('The Federal Reserve, how it operates, and how it interacts with private banks.',\n",
       "  'Big question. But here we go!\\n\\nThe Federal Reserve is the United States\\' \\'central bank,\\' which basically means that it is just like a normal bank--except it has this totally awesome extra power that no other organization (bank or otherwise) in the United States can have (according to [Article 1, Section 8 of the Constitution](_URL_0_)): it can create money. To keep this ELI5, I won\\'t explain monetary policy or anything like that beyond just to say how the Fed does this and why.\\n\\nThere are a couple of big functions of the Fed, and all of them focus on one of the Fed\\'s two \"Dual Mandates\" (or, arguably, a third goal I\\'ll explain in a second). The Dual Mandates are to create fiscal policies that promote \"maximum employment\" (meaning \\'as many people have jobs as possible\\') or \"controlled inflation\" (meaning \\'prices don\\'t rise out of control\\'). If you don\\'t know much about economics, cover your ears because I\\'m going to spoil Macroeconomics 101 for you: you can\\'t give everyone jobs AND have low inflation. Employment and inflation are tied together: when one goes up, so does the other. The \"Dual Mandate\" is really just a way to articulate the third, over-arching goal: to keep the economy *stable*. To not let one rise so much that it causes the other to get out of whack. So that\\'s why the Fed does everything it does: either to control unemployment, or to control inflation but *always* to keep the economy stable.\\n\\nSo--what does the Fed do?\\n\\n- It\\'s the \"bank\\'s bank.\" This came into play a lot during the bank bailouts, which I\\'ll get to in a second, but it also has a more routine effect on the economy too: under the Fed is a system called the Check Clearing System. I won\\'t get into how it works, because it\\'s needlessly complicated for our purposes, but the important thing is that before it came around, when times were economically rough, your bank might not accept a check that I wrote to you from my account at my bank. Banks couldn\\'t be sure the money was in my account, and they didn\\'t want to have to sue my bank to get the money, and they didn\\'t want to piss you off by putting money in your account and then having to remove it when it turned out that my check wasn\\'t good. So the Fed acts as a neutral go-between between the banks involved in a check transaction (which is why checks take a couple of days to clear), and the result is that if you write a check to somebody--no matter where they do their banking--they\\'ll be able to cash it. \\n\\n- It can give banks huge sums of money very quickly. This, of course, sounds like a bad idea. But remember: one of the goals the Fed has is to keep the economy stable. And if banks stop trusting that other banks have enough money to pay them, they will clam up and stop doing business with them, which will stop the economy in its tracks. So if it looks like a huge bank might go bust because it can\\'t borrow enough to cover its debts, the Fed can become the \"Lender of Last Resort,\" which basically just means that...\\n\\n- It can create money. This is probably the most powerful thing the Fed can do because it violates every rule about money there is. If you want to get $10 to buy something, you need to get it from someone else, but that person had to get it from someone, and that someone had to get it from someone else, and so on. Everybody gets money from someone--but not the Fed. The Fed is the first step in this chain: it made that $10 out of thin air. You asked earlier how the Fed works with banks, and this is a big way: part of the way that Check Clearing System I mentioned earlier works is that each bank that participates in it (which is pretty much all of them, because why would you want to open an account with a bank you can\\'t take other banks\\' checks to?) has an account with the Federal Reserve (which is not unlike your account at your bank in that it has a account balance). Now, the Fed can create money in two ways: it can walk over to a Federal Mint (like the ones in Philadelphia or San Fransisco) and literally ask them to print the amount of money it wants, or it can go into the accounts banks have with the Fed and change the amount of money in the account to a higher number. When banks wake up the next morning and see that they have more money than they thought, they\\'ll immediately start lending it out (because banks want to lend money--it\\'s how *they* make money!) and that gets the economy\\'s gears moving. Using this second way, the Fed can create and move huge sums--trillions of dollars--*in just a few minutes*. The fact that the Fed can magically save a bank before it goes under can be used to avert a bank panic--which is one of the forces which worsened the Great Depression, and, again, this all speaks to the Fed\\'s goal to keep the economy stable.\\n\\n- It can set interest rates. Most of the time, when the Fed creates money, it lends it out to banks. So say the Fed decides to create $1 billion today.

Looks like the two main theories are that (1) the amount of use a finger/toe gets affects nail growth rate, which would also explain why longer fingers and dominant hands have faster-growing nails, or that (2) fingernails grow faster than toenails because of higher blood flow, since your fingers are closer to your heart than your toes.\\n\\nThis is a summary of a few google results I found, so probably oversimplified and missing some stuff.

Skin lotions/moisturizers all mimic this natural effect. \\n\\nJust pouring water on wouldn\\'t help (it could even hurt, by stripping away more of the oil), because the protective coating is an oil. Drinking water and staying hydrated in other ways can help replenish the water your body is constantly losing. Water loss through the skin (if you\\'re not sweating) is actually somewhat small though.\\n\\nCracking and tearing of skin is basically what chapped lips actually are. Not only is the skin on our lips some of the thinnest on our body, but it also lacks the glands that produce sebum. The lips do get some protection from the glands in the surrounding skin, but not a lot. The thin skin combined with a weak protective coating causes the lips to dry out more frequently. In cold air (which is naturally drier than warm air), the lips dry out faster than our body can compensate, thus giving you chapped lips. \\n\\nThis is why people use chapstick, which is basically just wax, it mimics the effect of the body\\'s natural oils by trapping moisture.

It should be taken with a grain of salt, but it does posit a number of very good theories.\\n\\nEssentially what it boils down to (at least in that particular author's opinion), is food supply. The agricultural revolution in Europe led to more efficient farming methods that required less work for more food. Less work equals more time, more time leads to boredom, boredom leads to curiosity, et cetera. So while everyone else around the world was spending all their daylight hours farming, Europe was spending a few daylight hours farming and the rest tinkering with stuff. This, theoretically, jump-started the scientific progress of the Europeans, and led to their eventual domination of the globe.\\n\\nTo play Devil's advocate, however, there were a number of other highly successful and powerful empires and civilizations throughout history, some of which we know quite a bit about (the Egyptians, the Chinese, the Sumerians), and some of which we don't (the Native Americans and the Zimbabweans, for instance). Many of these empires developed, for their time, very advanced technology, but all of these empires inevitably collapsed and much of that technology was then lost. Only very recently (as far as human history is concerned) has Europe held such dominance in technology. It should also be noted that Europe rose to power in the form of Rome and Macedonia, but also collapsed into the Dark Ages before re-rising to power in the modern context. A great deal of Europe's post-Dark Ages society is based on science and math kept alive by the Arabs (algebra and trigonometry, among others), and wouldn't have been possible without the Crusades bringing a lot of that information back.\\n\\nSo I guess the simplest explanation is probably pure luck. Of all the incredibly powerful civilizations that rose up and fell throughout history, Europe managed to do so right on the cusp of the Industrial Revolution and rise of globalization, ensuring their global dominance in the modern age. One might argue, however, that the balance of technological power is slowly shifting back towards the east, as China and India are definitely making up for lost time in the technological race against America and Europe. I disagree with the top answer here. To understand anything about why some countries have more technology and some less, must first understand what is prosperity, and why is a country richer or poorer.\\n\\nLet me give you an example, lets first take an example of Robinson Crusoe who got stranded on an island. He catches fishes everyday from 8AM to 5PM and eats them. Since he just landed on the island, he catches these fishes by hand and he is able to catch 25 fishes everyday. Since Crusoe came from a modern society he realizes that he can build a net, and that will enable him to catch a lot more fishes. Unfortunately, he also realizes that he cannot just blink and wish a fishing net, he must build it, and making a fishing net requires 5 days of his work. The problem in front of Crusoe is that if he starts to work for 5 full days to build that net, then he won’t be able to catch any fish therefore he will starve to death.\\n\\nCrusoe in this scenario faces the problem of lack of capital. He needs capital to sustain himself until he extends the structure of production(that is from using only hands to catch fish, he uses hands to build a fishing net, which he uses to catch fishes. He realizes that by building that fishing net he will be able to catch 300 fishes everyday.\\n\\nSo Crusoe has 2 options, he can either:\\n\\nEat only 20 fishes everyday, and store the 5 uneaten fishes; Keep on doing this for 20 days, which will get him 100 fishes, which are good enough for him to sustain himself for five days when he won’t be able to work.\\n\\nCatch only 20 fishes each day and spend that extra time in building the net, so he will be spreading his 5 days of work, over 20 days.\\n\\nIn either of the two cases Crusoe has deferred his present consumption of 5 fishes everyday so that after he builds the net he is now able to produce and consume a LOT more fishes everyday. He can either catch 300 fishes and maybe consume them all, or make more dishes out of them, etc etc, or he could continue to catch only 25 fishes everyday, work less and have more leisure time, and spending the remaining time in working on art, literature, maybe music etc.\\n\\nA poor african country is exactly like Crusoe without the fishing net, and a rich western country like America is exactly like Crusoe with a fishing net. These African countries may figure out Technologies by merely copying western technologies, but what the knowledge isn't enough, what they really need is enough savings to lengthen the structure of production. If they are catching fishes by hand then they need to save enough to be able to feed themselves when they build a fishing net(let's call it sideways production).\\xa0\\n\\nThis is the exact reason why China is producing iPads and iPods for US but not for themselves, because they don't have enough savings by themselves to sustain themselves when they try to upgrade their capital goods.\\n\\nIts easier for western countries to produce a lot without giving up a lot of present goods, America has a lot of time to spend on art, literature, music, etc. This is the exact reason why their athletes and sportsmen win so many medals in Olympics, they have the disposable income and time to train themselves for sports, whereas in poor countries people still spend most of their time catching fishes by hand.\\n\\nIn order to build more capital, you require two things:\\n\\nPeople should be willing to put a lot of present goods for later consumption, I.e.\\xa0\\nWhen they put their present goods for later consumption, nothing should reduce or steal away their capital from them.\\n\\nLet me elaborate what I meant by nothing should reduce or steal away the capital from people who are deferring their present consumption for future. In the above example of Crusoe, lets say Crusoe’s fishes got rotten because they weren’t stored properly, so his capital has been destroyed, now to achieve the same earlier result he will have to build his savings again.\\n\\nTake another scenario, lets say Man Friday, is another cast away, who drifted to the other part of the Island, he also catches fishes by hand, but he is able to catch only 10 fishes because he is not that good with catching fishes. When Crusoe was saving 5 fishes everyday, Man Friday decried that Crusoe was being unfair and hoarding fishes, and it was causing income inequality, also Crusoe being more dexterous with fishing, must feed Man Friday some of his fishes. So everyday Man Friday raids Crusoe’s extra fishes and consumes them in the name of making the society more equal. In this case again Crusoe’s capital has been depleted, and he will never be able to build that fishing net, and although Man Friday and Crusoe will be a bit more equal, they will remain poor. In fact soon Crusoe will realize that he has no incentive to really starve himself by 5 fishes, so he will either consume all 25 fishes or will catch only 5 fishes each day.\\n\\nHad Man Friday allowed Crusoe to build his net, Crusoe would have been able to produce a lot more fishes everyday, and then Man Friday could then provide Crusoe with some other services, in exchange for his fishes. Lets just say all Man Friday is good at, is dancing and creating stories and telling them passionately, since they both are stranded on an island, Crusoe might value this entertainment service a lot, so Crusoe works all day catching 300 fishes, and gives 100 fishes to Man Friday in exchange of Man Friday’s entertainment services. This service would not be possible in a society without more capital accumulation.\\n\\nIf Crusoe isn't allowed to save because the property rights lack in his country then Crusoe’s net wouldn’t have been built, and Crusoe would have remained relatively rich(because he caught 25 fishes everyday and consumed 20), and Man Friday would have remained poor(because he caught only 10 fishes everyday and was able to consume only 15).\\xa0\\n\\ntl;dr: African countries have less technology because they don't have an ability to use that technology because of lack of Capital accumulation. Capital accumulates faster in countries with stronger property rights. The 'free time' HelioSeven is talking about is nothing but time they acquired through savings. *Guns, Germs, and Steel* is a great book that describes this phenomenon in detail. It had to do with the ease with which technology traveled, the kind of large livestock available, and how many nutritious crops were available to the people The biggest difference is the peoples of Africa were hunter/gathers, they had to be. Food was scarce so they always had to move on and find more. In Europe the climate allowed for the development of farming and agriculture, they could settle down in one place for life and always have food and the like on hand. They had more time to deal with other problems and develop, rather than always concern themselves with their next meal.\\n\\nThere were other factors, but that was a big one.\"),\n",

I mean vegetables vs. meat, chicken vs. beef, store bought vs. homemade. One word: Volume. \\n\\nFood is pretty cheap to make in bulk. Plus not everyone eats like it\\'s their last meal. Those that do are usually balanced out by people that are reasonable.  \\n\\nThere\\'s a few exceptions like casino buffets.

They can give away the house because they know you\\'ll hit the casino floor later to make it up 10 fold. \\n\\nThe one place that confuses me is Golden Corral because they\\'re an independent business. $10 doesn\\'t buy you much in terms of food and they have some \"good\" stuff like steak. Even though it\\'s sirloin at $2-3/lb, that gets eaten up quite quickly. Their margins must be pretty thin.  \\n\\nBut overall, the food is cheap and cooked in volume so there\\'s lots of room to move around. I used to work at a fine dining restaurant that served a fancy brunch buffet every Sunday. \\n\\nOne day a very thin lady started to show up every Sunday right when we opened.  She always came in alone and made a bee line for the bowl of peel and eat shrimp.  She would load her plate up with nothing else then go back to her seat and eat all of them. Then she would wait until we refilled it and then she would go back again.   She would do this until we were out.   \\n\\nThe waitstaff wondered how she was able to eat 6+ pounds of shrimp in a few hours.  I thought she was putting it into her purse.    On her third visit, one of the female staff discreetly monitored her every move.   She quickly found out that our guest would make quick trips to the bathroom where she would vomit up everything she ate and then go back and load up on more shrimp. \\n\\nShe got the incorrect nickname \"Anna\" short for Anorexic (It should have been Bulimia but we weren\\'t clever enough to come up with an innocent female name we could refer to her as in front of other guests).   \"Anna\" would also rarely speak to us.  She would smile when appropriate, and either nod or shake her head when asked a question. \\n\\nOnce our boss (who never came in on Sundays) found out he did some quick calculations and figured she was losing us too much money.    Rather than ban her, he simply had us change our peel and eat strategy.  We broke up the peel and eat shrimp from one big bowl into several smaller bowls scattered throughout the buffet line.   We were told NOT to refill them until she left.  \\n\\nThe next Sunday, \"Anna\" showed up and at first frowned at the change in her routine. She had to go through the entire buffet line to get all of the shrimp.  She also had to empty each of the bowls as she came across them.  Her usual attempts at discretion were no longer working and the guests in line with her started to make comments like \"Wow- are you on a shrimp only diet?\"  and \"Hey, leave some for the rest of us!\"   \"Anna\" hurried back to her seat, resumed her usual ritual of binging and purging and then sat quietly waiting for us to refill the bowls.  I only refilled the one at the end of the buffet so other guests could get some before she got to it.    I left the rest of them empty.  If any other guest asked for them, I would tell them we were out then quietly take a small bowl out to their table (out of sight of \"Anna\" of course).    \\n\\nAfter about an hour of sitting with a plate of shrimp peelings, \"Anna\" was forced to actually interact with us and ask about the shrimp.  When she was told we were out she became visibly upset and stormed out.     We never saw her again after that. > How are buffets profitable?\\n\\nSometimes they\\'re not:\\n\\nYears ago in my younger, stupider, days I was doing a construction job out in the country with a crew of hillbillies.  We got talking one Friday about a local place that makes delicious food.  Well, they also had a really good buffet, and after a little day-dreamin\\' and droolin\\' we all decided to stop by there after work for dinner.\\n\\nYou gotta understand that even with our boots off and our stomachs empty weren\\'t none of us small guys:  I don\\'t think there was anyone on that job less than 220 pounds.  And because of the prospect of delicious \"All You Can Eat\" some of the guys were even going light on snacks and lunch in order to keep extra room for dinner.\\n\\nSo after a 10 hour day, we shove off and make our way over to the buffet and we just start *digging in*.  We\\'re eating like we invented it.  They\\'d bring out a steam tray of pasta?  That\\'s our steam tray of pasta.  Another of dumplings?  Wasn\\'t even likely to reach the buffet table before it ends up on our plates.\\n\\nWell, after a time, when we\\'d accumulated a stack of plates that could\\'ve stocked a Crate-N-Barrel, this grizzled guy comes sauntering over to our table.  He identifies himself as the owner:\\n\\n*\"Is the food good?\"*  \\n\\nWe said it was.\\n\\n*\"Y\\'all enjoying yourselves?  Getting enough to eat?\"*\\n\\nWe said we were.\\n\\n*\"That\\'s fine.  I just wanted to make sure y\\'all enjoyed it, because once you\\'re done here, I don\\'t ever want to see a single one of you guys back in here again.\"*\\n\\nHe hit us all with a near fatal dose of the Evil Eye and then turned his back and sauntered back to the kitchen.\\n\\nAnd that\\'s how I learned that sometimes it\\'s not really All You Can Eat. Not everyone takes \"All you can eat\" as a personal challenge. Also there\\'s some psychology involved. It\\'s no accident the salad bar and pastas are in front, and the meat carving station is way in the back. Hello, I worked in a restaurant.\\n\\n- The price for a buffet meal is fairly high. $25 to $30 during dinner.\\n\\n- Most people can only eat a certain amount, particularly children.\\n\\n- Extra money is made on expensive drinks.\\n\\n- The buffet is organized in such a way that there are a lot of cheap foods (like rice) that brings down cost per customer. Normally, people don\\'t just eat meat. They\\'ll put some rice, or salad on the side.\\n\\n- Food is bought in larger quantities, so they get better wholesale prices.\\n\\n- Less staff. No one has to go around actively serving customers.\\n\\nBut keep in mind the profits are still pretty thin. Opening a buffet doesn\\'t mean instant success. I think some one touched on it... but the buffet is not the only income. Think drinks. Fountain drinks cost a few cents per fill but restaurants often charge $2+ making a huge profit. Alcoholic beverages if served at the establishment are often another huge source of profit. I think some places have a few tricks to curb your appetite. The best one I can think of off the top of my head is at a brewery here called granite city. They have a Sunday breakfast buffet with prime rib, thick bacon and so on. But they also bring to your table, for each person, something I deemed the \"stomach plug\". These stomach plugs are giant cinnamon rolls. Each one equals about 2-3 average sized cinnamon rolls. OK. I work at a pizza place that does buffets. It costs $8 with a drink to get the buffet. $8 is about the price of a medium (12inch) pizza here. Most people won\\'t / can\\'t eat any more than how much is on a medium pizza so we\\'ll usually only have about 1 pizza per person out and the bread sticks and cinnamon sticks are distributed to everyone almost evenly. Even though we make less than someone buying a pizza straight up, it\\'s still profitable. Oh and when it comes to pizza buffets, don\\'t believe that the pizza you get is lower quality. It isn\\'t. After a bit of being on a metal pan (like an hr) the crust will get soggy from grease and will taste pretty bad but when you put it in the cardboard box for take out or delivery, the box absorbs the grease that goes to the bottom and the pizza\\'s crust is not soggy. \\n\\nTl;Dr - if you\\'re at a pizza buffet, ask for some fresh custom pizzas. We don\\'t mind unless the buffet is nearly full already.\\n\\nEdit: For all you wondering, I work at Mr Jim\\'s which is a pizza chain mainly regional to the Dallas fort worth area. Not cici\\'s I could be wrong but isn\\'t one of the big costs in restaurants unused food; ingredients that people don\\'t order. Buffets don\\'t have this issue I assume. Obviously not the full answer but probably a contributing factor. It\\'s an *entirely* different business model than running a restaurant.  You have to do a lot of observation and make sure that items are put up that are constantly popular since leftovers will cut into your profits. \\n\\nThere are many cost saving measures that make a buffet quite profitable. The biggest consideration that it takes less staff to actually run a buffet than it takes to run a service in a restaurant. Labor is a really large percentage of your operating cost and a buffet can schedule employees in a pretty stable and regular manner because when they are not running to the line, they can be preparing in bulk. \\n\\nIt takes fewer employees to refill items than it does to individually plate items and run them to the table. Since no one is waiting for food, higher table turnover. So, more volume. \\n\\n* Portion control - Expensive proteins are usually not self serve. \\n\\n* The salad bar - Getting people to fill up on salad lessens the amount o things that they eat, overall. This is why the salad bar is the beginning of the buffet. And produce is cheap.\\n\\n* The dessert bar - Overall, desserts are super cheap to make. And if someone sees a sea of desserts, they might slow down so that they can gorge on desserts. \\n\\n* Item placement - There is an entire psychology behind where things are being placed. Starches are cheap, and you will find them easily accessible placed to the front of the proteins.\\n\\n* Smaller serving utensils - Sounds stupid, but it\\'s true. A smaller serving utensil encourages portion control.\\n\\n* The plates are smaller -Requires more trips to the food line.\\n\\n* There is never a horrible rush - You don\\'t need to drop everything and deal with a huge pile of orders that are up. This frees your back of house staff to create a steady flow of prepared items. Gives a lot of breathing space to the prep and cooking staff. \\n\\n* Making everything from scratch - It may not taste so great because it sits around for a while, but they do try and make everything from scratch. This is because making it from scratch is far cheaper with regards to food costs. A bag of prepared french fries costs $6 for a 5 lb bag while a 50 lb sack of potatoes costs $12. \\n\\n* Budgeting - You can figure out what the per person food costs are and average it out with a reasonable margin. Buffets are make-to-inventory, while restaurants are make-to-order. Make-to-inventory is always cheaper, since the cooks can cook for the busy times during the slow times. If you make to order, then you have to wait for the order before cooking it.\\n\\nAs an extra bonus, cooking two servings of a dish takes less time than cooking one serving twice. I was at a chinese food buffet once when a group of football players came in (it was across the street from a university.) \\n\\nThe staff came out with bowls of celery and started adding it to every  dish. There\\'s nothing like cellulose to fill the gut and slow them down a bit. I own and operate a \"by-the-pound\" buffet and being able to buy in bulk saves a ton of money. I buy 200 pounds of chicken on Monday because Tuesday is soul food day. It\\'s easier and cheaper than buying 50 pounds of chicken that you have to prepare individually for a table that is served by a waiter. My profit margins are great because it\\'s by the pound. People come in, they put food on their tray, they pay, and leave. I\\'m not an expert on how buffets operate, but I can give you some information relating to how/why buffets *should be* profitable based on my past high-end catering experience.\\n\\nLet\\'s say the price for an adult is $19.95 for an all-you-can-eat buffet. From my experience (regardless of the price), the less expensive and \"gut-busting\" food items are displayed first (i.e. bread, crackers, vegetable and fruit displays, salads, soups, and the almighty pasta courses) with the more expensive items at the very end (carved meats, seafood, ribs, fish, etc.).\\n\\nI call the former \"gut-busters\" because most of these items are filled with carbohydrates (bread, pasta, hearty soups, etc.) and fill a person\\'s stomach at a greater rate opposed to eating lighter foods or proteins, especially when said carbs come in contact with liquids (water, tea, soda,beer, alcohol).  \\n\\nBuffet restaurants know this and use it to their advantage as they assume most people will simply load up their first plate with the \"gut-busting\" items and when they get to the more expensive items, they don\\'t have enough room on their plate and figure that they\\'ll just come back for seconds. They\\'re anticipating that by the end of your first plate, you\\'re too full to even think about going back for seconds. So let\\'s say you ate tiny portions of a few salads, pastas, had some raw veggies, a couple pieces of fruit, and maybe a bowl of soup. All told, what you just ate might amount to $3 at-cost to the restaurant. And that $19.95 you just shelled out to eat that food? The standard food cost percentage in restaurants is 35%, give or take a percentage point; buffets are looking for anywhere between 20-28% food cost. Remember that $3 you just ate although you paid $19.95 for the privilege? That comes out to 15.04% food cost to the restaurant: In layman\\'s terms, BOOM! PROFIT!. \\n\\nLet\\'s say you ate all of the food mentioned above and are still hungry so you grab a few slices of prime rib and a few shrimp. The cost of your plates now jumped from $3 to maybe $5. You feel like you got your money\\'s worth because not only did you eat salad, veggies, fruit, pasta, soup, prime rib, and shrimp, but you\\'re leaving full and satisfied. You surely dented the restaurant\\'s profits because you ate so much right? Wrong. By you eating that extra protein you increased their food-cost from 15.04% to 25.1%; still within their targeted food-cost percentage to make a profit. Couple this with low labor costs and overhead (I\\'m reaching here, based on how efficient each individual buffet is managed), they can be highly profitable enterprises when done correctly and constantly monitored. \\n\\nAll told, if you choose to eat at these establishments, eat what you want however much you want but please keep in mind they\\'re also trying to run and operate a successful business. Going straight to the higher-end items and eating only these items is bad form in my opinion. But do as you wish. You rang? :)\\n\\nIt\\'s all been covered. For every one big eater there are four who are not. We are $30 plus, and adults still eat the kids mashed potatoes. Meat is expensive. We use the cheaper cuts of quality product if that makes sense. Chicken that is cooked but never exposed to guests and not used today is in tomorrow\\'s chicken based soup. I used to manage a buffet, so I actually know this topic!  Buffets make money by enticing you with high price items, then once you are in the building, convincing you to fill your plates with low cost items.  \\n\\n  In the same way that grocery stores design their layouts to make you spend more, profitable buffets will offer breads, vegetables, and low quality meats (cheap stuff) at the beginning of the line, allowing you to fill your plate, while reserving expensive items (steak, shrimp, and the like) for the end of the line.  \\n\\n   A good manager knows to locate his expensive items at strategic locations and to offer them in small portion sizes, while making cheaper items look as appetizing as possible.  That is why Golden Corral will usually cut your steaks for you, as well as why the rolls are freaking delicious and right at the beginning of the line! A few major reasons buffets yield profit (although they typically don\\'t yield as much as you would think).\\n\\n * Most people don\\'t put back as much food as you think. On average, most customers put back about two plates, which really isn\\'t all that much. Occasionally you have someone who can put away half the spread on their own, but they are typically the oddity. The money you paid for the buffet probably covers about three plates worth of food, so if you only eat two, each person is paying for food they don\\'t eat, effectively making up for that one fat-ass whose on his 9th plate. \\n\\n * Buffets are normally *loaded* with rice and/or pasta. Those are dirt cheap. Rice, before cooking, only costs ~$1/Lb, and on average will expand to double it\\'s size when cooked (although that varies on what type of rice you are using), so if you\\'re paying $8 for a buffet, and eating mostly rice, let\\'s say you manage to put back 1.5lbs of it (which is an obscene amount), the restaurant just made ~$5.50 in profit off you. (That figure accounts for the veggies and/or sauce that were in the rice, as well). Similar prices apply to most pastas. \\n\\n * Labor. A buffet can be almost entirely prepped, set up, and run, by 2 people. During actual service, depending on how busy the place is, sometimes just 1 person. Labor makes up for a good portion of what you are paying for when you go out to eat, so cutting that cost down is a substantial reason why buffets can be so cheap.\\n\\n * Volume. Restaurants make money by volume. Even if you don\\'t make a significant amount of money with each plate you sell, if you sell lots of them, you make lots of money. Buffets operate on a similar principal. Sell lots of people food without a huge profit margin, and you will still make a large profit (the margin itself won\\'t be that high, but positive cash flow will be). \\n\\nThere are other \"tricks\", too. Put the cheap/filling stuff at the beginning of the buffet, and anything that is more expensive towards the end. Make sure everything is heavy on the starches (rice, potatoes, pasta) as they tend to be cheap and very filling. Throw a few high-end proteins (steak, crab legs, etc.) on the buffet towards the end. The name will attract customers, but it\\'s very likely not many people will eat it, so you only have to prep a little bit of it. Think of it like an advertising budget. \\n\\nThe list of nuances for making a buffet profitable could go on for a while, but those are the big points. \\n\\nSource: Been a chef for close on 15 years, set up more buffets than you\\'ve had hot meals. Everything is way cheaper than you think.  This is how all business make money. They have a merchant account. They buy from distributors at almost cost. That is extremely cheaper than what you as a customer can get. When I was younger I worked for various retail and restaurant chains. Even things marked down or on sale are often still marked up 100 percent for what the business payed.  \\nLook at sodas and fries for example.  Large fries or a soda cost 2 bucks or more. You can go to club stores and get a whole bag of fries for 3 or a box of soda syrup that will pour out hundreds of drinks for 50. When I go to a buffet, I typically get three plates. One for a main course, one for everything I missed, and one for desserts. My friend took a Chinese buffet to the cleaners once.  He sat and ate so much, they told him he either had to leave or pay for dinner too.  It *started* as lunch. Chef here. Buffets are priced differently than a typical restaurant. In a restaurant each dish is price in such a way that the food costs somewhere between 18-35% of the total price, on average (depends on the dish and the type of restaurant). \\n\\nAt a buffet you obviously can\\'t do that because everyone pays the same regardless of what they eat, or how much.\\n\\nInstead pricing is typically done based on projected seating. If we turn 6 tables of 4 every hour, and we\\'re open 12 hours a day, that equates to a grand total of 288 customers on an average day (minimum). Pricing is done relative to that number such that everything stays afloat and produces a profit. For example a 10% profit (pretty typical for a restaurant) on $20,000/week operating costs would be $22,000 so divide that by your average number of weekly customers found using the above calculation (288*7, or however many days a week you\\'re open) and you\\'ll get your final recommended price. $11/person in this particular example.\\n\\nNote: numbers were pulled out of my ass and don\\'t reflect any specific restaurant or industry standard\\n\\nTL;DR: Buffets are priced based on knowing on average how many people you\\'ll serve and making sure that you account for all your operating costs. Even the fattest of fat people cannot eat more than it costs the buffet in materials and labour to feed them.\\n\\nBulk cooking is much cheaper than what you do at home. Cooking 400 gallons of marinara is much cheaper than cooking a half gallon 800 times. You can order tomatoes and meat in bulk direct from the supplier.\\n\\nBuffets charge about $20-$50 depending on how classy a buffet it is. Cheap beef (one of the more expensive ingredients involved) grosses retail at around $2 per pound. So that\\'s 10 pounds of the most expensive ingredient - something you could never eat in a sitting. I worked at a buffet place years ago. Things may have changed, but all I had to do was clear used plates off the table and refill drinks. (I also had to do other normal server duties; restock plates, glasses, roll silverware, etc) The shitty part was that I got paid minimum wage **for a server** I made less than $2.00/hr and bc I wasn\\'t actually a *real* server (and bc it was a buffet place) so people **never** tipped. So I would walk out on a Friday night with a few quarters from the people who did leave tips. I quit after 2 nights. Oh, and In those 2 nights I witnessed 3 people vomit in the parking lot when leaving from stuffing themselves. Worst job ever. I\\'ve spent time managing in a buffet on the LV Strip. I can tell you a few quick things:\\n\\nIt didn\\'t matter if someone wanted a refund.\\n\\nIt didn\\'t matter if someone came in with their kids, didn\\'t pay for themselves cause they weren\\'t eating, and then when their kid didn\\'t like the food asked if they could eat instead of the kid.\\n\\nThe point of restaurants in a casino, including the buffet, is to keep the customer happy so they\\'ll stay in the building and go back and gamble. You\\'re in the hospitality industry less than you are in food and beverage. It\\'s all about keeping the customer in the building and spending money. It doesn\\'t matter if I gave you a twenty-two dollar steak, because ten minutes after you left you dropped fifty bucks playing blackjack and went to the ATM.\\n\\nSometimes, often times, it\\'s the other end of it too. People have ALREADY lost money, and they decided to get up to come eat, and you\\'re the closest person they can be angry with. I used to tell my staff, \"The angrier the customer, the more likely it is they probably just lost a TON of money.\" And thinking that usually helped you not empathize, but just straight laugh at their misfortune...which you need to do if you ever work Food and Bev.\\n\\nAll the books are somewhat separate in casinos though, you know? Like numbers are tracked per department, per restaurant, the same as they\\'re tracked in singular retail outlets for like GAP and stuff. So the buffet has X amount of covers they want to be doing an hour to stay profitable in comparison with last year, etc etc. But for the most part, it didn\\'t fucking matter what happened, it didn\\'t matter what we gave away. Just keep them happy, and keep them gambling. _URL_0_\\n\\nI guarantee that I could not eat $50 worth (cost/labor/overhead) of food from here.\\n\\nWhy? They had a million customers *before their first anniversary*. Volume purchasing and assembly line labor translates to the exact same item from a regular \"service\" restaurant would cost much more simply because of the economies of scale. They likely make more of one item in a day than a normal restaurant would make in a month or a year. I misread title as \"How are bullets profitable? How much money is usually made (on average) per customer at all you can eat bullets?\" until I realized I should renew my glasses. I asked the manager at CiCis (a pizza buffet) and he says it takes them $0.25 to make a pizza, so your have to eat 20 entire pizzas for them to lose money You never have to wait long for a soda refill at a buffett because it is cheap and fill you up Your enjoyment rates also decrease every time you return. The business entices you, while knowing that each additional plate of food provides less utility than the one before, meaning all customers will stop returning when their \"limit\" is reached, that is, when they are too full and their enjoyment drops. Considering other factors such as the number of people they can entertain at a given time, the \"limit\" would basically be their basis on how much or what food would be served in a day. In economics this is the [law of diminishing marginal utility](_URL_1_). Usually the buffet buys in bulk like a lot of food to make a profit, also drinks (besides water) help with getting a profit\\n Like Chinese buffets large ones order so much to get a price break , good luck trying to make em lose a profit unless all you eat is prime rib, crab legs or chicken wings\\n \\n\\nMy buddy and his friend actually did eating contests at buffets subsequently he and his friends ended up getting kciked out as they ate too much. He and his friends aren\\'t fat either. It\\'s a little known fact that buffets are actually partially underwritten by Warren Buffet. It is a good way for him to get his name out there all over the country at minimal cost. Essentially unless you pack your guy so full of meat you won\\'t shit for a month buffets are profitable. People fill up on cheap starches and don\\'t eat much. In the case of a casino, the buffet might actually lose money, but attracts more customers who will gamble, increasing overall profits. Not sure about the high end ones but the buffet I worked at did it like this.\\n\\nThe largest pod and area was salads, this is also the cheapest to purchase. It was also closest to the front door. Busy day your waiting in line and looking at that. A lot of folks go for it first because of this.\\n\\nEntrees were the medium area. The smallest pod and most expensive was meats and the carving station. Usually a line for carving so it would mostly block the expensive stuff. The pod closest to the dining area was full of the cheaper side dishes. People tending to hit that first when going for warm food. The other main dish pod was different daily. So it could be Mexican on Monday and Italian the next. Usually not pricy over all it was not a large pod and off to the side.\\n\\nLast is desserts the smallest area and pod usually second in price behind the meats. Cook time was factored in to this. It was off to the other side of the restaurant total. Most things were pre-portioned as well. It was also arranged odd so again if we were busy it looked like a lot more people were in it. \\n\\nLayout was determined by corporate and we couldn\\'t change it. This was mainly to control the flow of people. Aim them at the cheap stuff and let them fill up on that. The drinks were in the middle of the dining area and we advertised them as free so people would drink a bunch of coke or sprite. This was dirt cheap for us. \\n\\nThe layout of the dining area was set to keep you from getting too comfy. Tables a little on the small side, booths pushed in just a little too close. No one hung out after eating so we could have a faster turn on the tables.\\n\\nSure you\\'d have people game the system so to speak. Show up right at change over pay lunch price and eat dinner. Or the guy that brought a book. Folks that would pile meats on their plate and not eat it all. My favorite were the fools that would bring in plastic bags and load it up full then try and walk out with a bag full of fried chicken. Usually the wait staff got them. You could tell even on a busy day if some one was loading up to take it home. The way buffets are priced is you add up the cost of all the food that was eaten. Divide it by the number of people served. That is your food cost per plate. Add in all of your fixed and variable costs plus whatever you  set for your profit(believe it or not most restaurants are lucky to see 8% profit margin).  You do this calculation on a regular basis to get the average cost throughout the year so be sure you have the right price set. Labor cost are one of the largest factors that go into the price of a food item and when they are produced in quantity you really see economies of scale pretty quickly.\\n\\nWhen you don\\'t gorge yourself you are making up for those who do\\n\\nBuffets in a casino are different since they typically don\\'t care to make a profit off of them and just want to get people in the door to gamble. My parents owned a small diner that they put a buffet into. Every day featured a different home cooked option like meatloaf, catfish, hamburger steaks, and one night was ribs. Eventually they had to shut the buffet down because it was causing the diner to bleed money. \\n\\nThe problem, as others have said, was that my parents did not use lower quality food and kept the same amount of staff (because the menu was still an option). The rib night was the real culprit and final nail in the coffin. The diner was in a small town and when rib night rolled around, every farmer and farm hand in the area came out of the woodwork to eat mountainous plate after plate of ribs. Often times they wouldn\\'t touch a single other item on the buffet. So from what I\\'ve read, by not buying a drink and avoiding the cheap foods that fill you up quickly and heading straight for the more expensive foods like meats, you will give the least profit to a buffet because you\\'ll be eating more expensive stuff that fills you up less, and drinks are a high source of income for buffets. \\n\\nWith that being said, even if you get more from your money for it, I don\\'t think trying to purposely make a buffet lose profit is a good thing, especially if you enjoy the restaurant. It seems like making them lose profit is something that\\'s hard to do without serious intent. The profit is made on people like me who pay $20 for all I can eat and I can\\'t eat more than one plate. For me it ends up being over-priced cafeteria food, which is why I don\\'t go to them.\\n\\n*Except* the buffet at the Bellagio in Las Vegas. It\\'s something like $45 a person and worth every penny. The key for me there is to take small portions so I can try lots of different stuff. As a kid buffets are like all your dreams have come true. I went to a buffet just the other night, I\\'m now older and a qualified chef, and i was amazed at how much of the produce was brought it. \\nPeople don\\'t seem to give it a thought or even care that it\\'s all pre-made and just heated or put on a plate, and of course they all think they\\'re getting a great deal. Food is not most of a restaurant\\'s cost -- think salaries, rent, equipment, advertising, etc. Those are fixed costs no matter how much or little a customer eats, or whether the customer comes in at all.\\n\\nBut from the customer\\'s viewpoint, the food is the most important part. So restauranteurs know that feeding them as much as they want is well worth it. most buffets make money by buying the cheapest food possible in the biggest quantity possible, and then charge $2 bucks per glass of pop.\\n\\nalso, i like how nearly every post in this thread has been hit by what i presume to by the Downvote Brigade, /r/ELI5 Battalion, NA(for North America) Company, American Platoon. lol\\n\\nEDIT: Fixed my unit reference. Former pizza buffet worker here.  We charged 7.95 for adult with soda for the buffet.  Me and an owner calculated that in order to get their moneys worth, a customer would have to eat 7 1/2 pizzas in one sitting\\n\\nedit: theres a big difference between 795 and 7.95 My uncle is a chef and recently started at Golden Corral (a chain buffet in the US). He says the profit is $0.15 after accounting for all costs. So, profit margin is low but volume is high. And as for one common type of buffet, casino buffets don\\'t need to make money as far as I can tell. They are basically loss leaders. My average cost per guest is 1.90, the base entry is 10$ and sodas are 2.5$ of pure profit (soda is in that cost) Usually they charge pretty steep for drinks and put ridiculous amounts of salt in the food'),\n",

       "  \"As food passes through the digestive tract, it encounters first the oesophagus and stomach, where it is broken down into digestible pieces, and then passes into the small and large intestines. For the most part (it is not quite as straight forward as this, but I'm trying to ELI5), the small intestine is where various nutrients are absorbed from the food at various points. Little nutrient absorption happens in the large intestine, but it is the main site of water absorbtion from the food that will eventually become stool. The consistency of the stool depends on (amongst other things) the amount of water absorbed from the large intestine, which in turn depends on the speed that the matter passes through. If the transit speed is slower, there is more time for the bowel to absorb water and the stool is drier.\\n\\nLoperamide, the main anti-diarrhoea drug used in most situations, acts at some of the same receptors in the brain as heroin and morphine (just not the ones that give you the good or the really really bad effects). When this interaction happens, it causes the brain to send a signal to the nerves controlling the muscles of the bowel (the myenteric plexus) which slows down their activity and reduces the transit speed of matter through the bowel, thus giving the bowel more time to absorb water and making the stool less wet and sloppy.\\n\\nI hope this explains things OK, any questions just shout my way and I'll try and answer!\\n\\nedit: a word.\"),\n",

Which is not only why it is easier to rip, but also when paper dries back out, it never looks the same. \\n\\nHere is a more technical answer i grabbed: \\n\\nPaper is mostly made from cellulose fibres (depending on the type there may also be filers and glazes like clay). Cellulose molecules bristle with hydroxyl (OH) groups, and these form hydrogen bonds with each other. It's these hydrogen bonds that make the individual fibres stiff, and also hold the fibres together.\\n\\nWater is also full of OH bonds, obviously since it's H22O, and the water molecules form hydrogen bonds with the hydroxyl groups on the cellulose, which breaks the hydrogen bonds that cellulose molecules form with each other. There are two results from this: firstly the cellulose fibes in the paper become floppy, because their internal hydrogen bonds are broken, and secondly the fibres separate from each other more easily. The combination of these two effects makes paper easier to tear apart when wet.\\n\\nMost organic materials show similar behaviour. For example cotton is also easier to tear when wet (cotton is also made mostly from cellulose).

       " ('If Ebola is so difficult to transmit (direct contact with bodily fluids), how do trained medical professionals with modern safety equipment contract the disease?',\n",
       "  'They\\'re in contact with bodily fluids far more often than you or I would be.  They take precautions, sure, but when you deal with something that frequently unlikely things can happen.\\n\\nEDIT - I should have also mentioned something about fatigue and how it can cause individual lapses in safety protocols.  This probably contributes pretty heavily, too. Ebola is, as you likely already know, transmited from person to person through bodily fluids (blood, mucus, etc.). The viral load in these bodily fluids only becomes high enough to infect another person AFTER he or she begins to show simptoms of illness. The combination of these two traits means that out in everyday society, where we avoid sick people and cover our sneezes, the disease doesn\\'t spread very quickly. \\n\\nWhen these sick people are admitted into a hospital, the medical professionals that work there are in almost constant contact with this sick person. Though the medical professionals may have safety equipment in the form of barriers to avoid contact with the bodily fluids that transmit infection, the huge frequency of exposure to the sick person means that the risk of an accidental infection (such as accidentally contaminating yourself while disrobing from the protective gear) is significantly higher. This is true of every illness that you would be hospitalized for, not just Ebola. I have a friend, he\\'s a chef. He works with very sharp knives for 12+ hours, usually 7 days a week. He knows how to use the tools of his trade properly, and is quite good at his job. He also cuts himself (and burns himself) WAY more than I do. Then again... I\\'m only around a hot stove for about 30min a day...maybe an hour if I\\'m cooking real food for supper. I have one knife, I use it for almost everything, but even so I probably only hold it for a few minutes a day. His exposure to potential mistake or accident involving a knife or hot stove is simply much higher than mine, even though I have no idea what I\\'m doing in the kitchen. I think this is a pretty good analogy for health care workers dealing with Ebola...they\\'re wading through the worst and most infectious area\\'s. They\\'re in the thick of it, intentionally getting involved with people who have the virus. They\\'re careful, sure...but nothing ever goes 100% properly every single time. They\\'re working in an environment where the margin of error is ZERO... as any mistake means potential infection. \\n\\nAlso, apparently the most dangerous part for the health professionals is when they\\'re taking off their gear. I read an article about a nurse who voulenteered...she described how they\\'re not supposed to be in the protective clothing for something like longer than an hour, and by the time you\\'re done You\\'re exhausted, hot, sore...your goggles are fogged up, your boots are full of sweat...and RIGHT NOW is the MOST dangerous moment of the day, because the entire outside of your gear is infectious, and you are at the very bottom of your game in terms of attention, co-ordination, and stamina. They\\'re trained for it all, and professionals to the extreme...but they\\'re still human. Combine these risks with the above massively increased exposure... I can see how it happens. \\n\\nEdit: [This is the article I mentioned.](_URL_1_)\\n\\nEdit2: Further info on sanitizing vs. sterilization from /u/TinyFishy, some [really great points](_URL_0_) that clarify the purpose and effectiveness of the sanitization procedure. The biggest reason is that as the disease progresses the amount of virus get to be huge.  Early in the disease essentially no virus is being shed by a patient.  When a patient has reached the near death stage, the patient can be bleeding from eyes, ears, mouth, nose, and spewing bloody diarrhea containing billions if not trillions of infectious virions.  \\n\\nELI5:  As a patient gets more ill the challenges of not being infected go up dramatically. They come in contact with the fluids when they are taking off the modern safety equipment.  If done correctly, then you should be able to put on, operate, and take off the equipment without contracting the disease but missteps and misinformation lead to mistakes while taking off the equipment. The first Dallas nurse who was infected reported remembering accidentally rubbing her nose while taking off the safety equipment...human error is probably enough to explain the small number of infections we\\'ve seen in the US.\\n\\nEdit: Some folks are saying it was a nurse in Spain who recalled touching her nose, rather than a nurse in Dallas. I can\\'t find a source to confirm either. My understanding is that—in addition to the fact that medical professionals are exposed to bodily fluids far more than the average person (as others have written)—Ebola is very *infectious* even though it isn\\'t highly *contagious*.  That means that the virus is normally hard to catch (low *contagion*) but it takes very little of the virus to develop the disease (highly *infectious*). Biomedical scientist here and part of the Ebola response team at a large and prestigious hospital on the east coast.\\n\\n1) The most recent persons to get it is a doctors without borders doc. What people don\\'t realize is that these doctors go into \"battle\" vastly under supplied in these foreign countries. They do not have Tyvek coveralls, respirators, gloves, and proper sterilization equipment. A lot of them because of supplies are forced to use the same pair of gloves on multiple patients for the day. Some don\\'t use gloves at all. \\n\\n2) Taking care of someone with Ebola is hell. There are literally body fluids everywhere. Imagine bloody decomposed fluid oozing out of every pore in your body, plus gallons of diarrhea and vomit. The protective equipment people are wearing here is good, but only if it stays intact and it doffed correctly. 90% of the infections occur because the person contaminates themselves when removing the soiled equipment. \\n\\n3) there\\'s more, but I\\'m at work and don\\'t feel like typing. \\n\\nTLDR: taking the protective gear off improperly contaminates you, and 3rd world country doctors don\\'t have the proper supplies. \\n\\nEdit: tubeless to Tyvek, damn phone autocorrect According to this article: _URL_2_, which is a great read by the way.  It only takes 1 particle of ebola to be lethal.  There are about 1 million particles of ebola that fit in this \"o\".  I have the upmost respect for those selfless health care workers that are risking their lives for their fellow humans. Patients with an active ebola infection can have between 6-12 LITERS of diarrhea a day which, in the US, we try to avoid putting down the sewer system. Now, imagine if you are a nurse caring for a patient with 6-12 LITERS of diarrhea a day with lots of little ebolas in it and you have to keep the diarrhea in the patient\\'s room (contained, of course) until biohazard company can incinerate it. There are so many ebolas all around you it can be difficult avoiding those little boogers. \\n\\nSource: health care worker\\n\\nEdit: I also want to say that I heard from a conference that those nurses in Texas had their necks partially exposed. Now, just imagine providing one on one care for someone shitting that much ebola out of their ass and vomiting ebolas constantly and trying to always replace that fluid for them so their heart can keep working so obviously they don\\'t die on you from premature dehydration AND THEN you have to keep gallons of ebola infected waste in the room with you until a special biohazard company can properly dispose of all of the ebola infected trash and bodily fluids so that the rest of the population can be protected from little ebolas. I mean, sheesh! Nurses are heroes.  Please stop saying I would accidentally touch my face with ebola diarrhea and vomit. That is gross. There is such a high chance of those damn microscopic ebolas in that diarrhea to accidentally get on your exposed neck from the mass ebola chaos that is probably going on in that room trying to keep that person alive. My brother is an ER doctor in an urban setting. We had this discussion. The first thing is that while Ebola requires contact to bodily fluids, it appears that Ebola transfers very easily when there is such contact. This is in contrast to HIV, which is not easily spread even when there is a contaminated needle stick. I mean, with HIV, the calculated risk of infection is only 1/200 if you\\'re having vaginal sex with an infected woman. So while Ebola requires contact with bodily fluids, it appears to be much more contagious than other diseases that doctors normally see once you do touch bodily fluids. \\n\\nFurthermore, most hospitals in the United States are not equipped to deal with quarantine situations. I said that doctors, prior to getting out of their personal protective equipment, should dip their gloves in a bleach solution and spray themselves with Lysol. He said that they have no facility at his hospital to do so. You just take your gloves off and hope you don\\'t smear yourself with it. You might double bag just to be sure. However, to me, that is fucking horseshit. A bucket of bleach solution and a Lysol spray shower should not cost more than a few hundred dollars. He said that FDA approval of a medical device would ensure that it\\'ll take forever to set up and it would cost a ridiculous amount of money. Biggest danger is removing the PPE, while it\\'s on it protects you, while you take it off it tries to kill you. Ebola is difficult to transmit in that you have to be in close proximity with someone before it is easy to transmit.\\n\\nMedical professionals have to be in close proximity with someone with Ebola, so it\\'s easy to transmit in those circumstances.\\n\\nThey take precautions, but there are lots of things that can go wrong. \\n\\nIt\\'s like asking \"If it\\'s so easy to avoid drowning by staying out of the ocean, why is it that sometimes deep sea divers drown despite all the safety equipment that they wear?\"\\n\\nYou don\\'t have to worry about drowning just walking down the street. Similarly, you don\\'t have to worry about Ebola just walking down the street.  But start sticking your head under water, or start touching people with Ebola and you need to be careful, and even with protective equipment sometimes something happens. I work as a medical professional The typical person who does not work in the field would probably be shocked at how awful the typical employee is at adhering to standard precautions (gloves/hand sanitizing after every interaction). \\n\\nSeriously...that shit doesn\\'t happen. I work in a hospital, and this was discussed at length by management and infection prevention.    The biggest factors were that there weren\\'t protocols for dealing with that patient in that hospital,  there weren\\'t specially trained people to deal with it, and the CDC did not get their team in place fast enough.   \\n\\nEbola is not contagious before symptoms appear and it doesn\\'t really get bad until 72 hours after your fever escalates over 101.   At Emory,  a specialized team of 40 is trained to deal with patients with Ebola and are the only health care workers that come into contact with the patient or their body fluids.   At Dallas, they had almost a hundred different people in contact with that patient, and they treated the patient like a normal droplet/contact isolation at first.  I\\'d say that it is a testament to the low R0 of the disease. \\n\\nWe have now formed an Ebola team at my hospital that consist of 34 people.    The CDC has made arrangements so that any patient that is confirmed to have Ebola will be transfered to a regional center that has been set up within 72 hours.   I\\'m on that team, and I\\'m not worried even if we do get a patient.    I know what I\\'m doing, understand the disease, and we are well trained.\\n\\nI equate the panic to the Aids epidemic of the 80s where people didn\\'t understand the virus and thought you could get it from hugging a patient or even using the bathroom.    There are many other things I would worry about more than Ebola.   I almost lost a friend to meningitis,  and I watched an 18 year old girl die from the flu last year.  In the US, influenza is estimated to facilitate the deaths of around 35,000 people in the average year, and people don\\'t want to take the vaccine because they don\\'t like needles. I\\'d like to add...\\n\\nas someone who recently went from never working with patients, to being in the rooms of 16 or so on any given day..\\n\\nMost non-healthcare associates don\\'t really have a good understanding of just how often you come in contact with bodily fluids. A LOT, I\\'d dare say the majority of patients are sitting down on chucks pads (basically, diapers spread out without velcro) because they\\'re too sick/physically unable to make it to the bathroom. \\n\\nThis means the nursing tech (usually 1 per unit....1 unit is anywhere from 10-16 or so patients) is essentially going room to room much of the day cleaning patients bed sheets and wiping their asses for them, literally. Gloves are great. Gowns are great. They aren\\'t perfect though. And when you\\'re doing it THAT often, its just a numbers game.\\n\\nNOW, think about how that nurse tech is one person going room to room. One mistake in one room is enough to potentially spread whatever germs to each person in the entire unit. \\n\\nAlso, family members/arrogant physicians often feel they are exempt to the disease prevention protocols. One huge issue at the hospital I work at is physicians being held accountable for not taking proper precautions. Doctors Without Borders: 700 served. Infected: 4. So maybe good old fashioned accidental, and most likely due to sleep deprivation. Add to that these 700 doctors are not working in state of the art facilities. The medical professionals commonly contract the disease during the process of removing their safety equipment.  The equipment itself is quite good at keeping the virus on the outside of itself and not letting it inside, but that means the virus stays on the outside of the suit.  The problem comes when the suits are taken off, which must be carefully done or else you risk exposing your unprotected skin to the virus on the outside of the suit.  \\n\\nTo get a picture of the problem, try an experiment.  The next time you are taking your clothes off, try to take them off without touching the exterior of your clothing at all.  Mess up once and you have just been exposed to Ebola. I oddly enough just asked my friend this questions. She\\'s a nurse in an Intensive Care Unit. \\n\\nWhen you treat really sick people like Ebola patients you were lots of protective gear. \\n\\nEbola patients unfortunately have lots of fluids coming out of them (blood, diarrhea, vomit) and that gets on all your protective gear.  \\n\\nThere is a very precise way that you are supposed to remove your gear so that you don\\'t get fluids on your skin. But it\\'s very hard to do perfectly. It\\'s very hard to remove dirty gloves without touching skin. \\n\\nAll you need is one irritated hair on your body for the virus to sneak in after you accidentally touch skin with dirty clothes.  \\n\\nMost hospitals rarely practice the procedures since these types of diseases are so uncommon. The patients are vomiting, shitting like crazy, bleeding and sweating from their fever...and someone has to clean it all up....then take everything off in the perfect order so they dont get anything on them... While the personal protective equipment (PPE) does its job while you\\'re wearing it, taking it off and disposing of it is a tricky and dangerous task. \\n\\nTaking the equipment off improperly is believed to be how the nurse in Texas was infected.  Removing gloves or the helmet/face mask, after handling a specimen (urine, poop),  in the wrong order can easily lead to contamination and subsequent infection.  \\n\\nJust as much training is needed for taking the equipment off as is putting the equipment on, if not more. One little slip up in the order of removal or disposal of the contaminated equipment and it could spell disaster. I work in a hospital.  Right now, a lot of our medical providers are concerned that they don\\'t have enough training in how to remove their gear in a way that doesn\\'t infect themselves.  \\n\\nSay you\\'re wearing latex gloves.  You use one glove to take off the other, fine.  But now how do you take off the remaining glove without touching it?\\n\\nThat\\'s how medical staff members are getting infected.  They aren\\'t trained in safe removal of their gear. The other top answers are terrible\\n\\nELI5 - improper use of safety equipment, including the point at which you take it off.\\n\\nUnderstand that few nurses regularly deal with \"isolation\" patients, let alone a level-3 quarantine biological agent. So it\\'s somewhat understandable that they aren\\'t perfect when using protective gear. Unfortunately viruses aren\\'t forgiving if you, for example, accidentally touch the outside of your gloves or headgear.\\n\\nSource - wife works with level 1 and 2 biological agents Long story short - removing gowns and gloves without contaminating yourself is much more difficult than one would think after working your 8-10 hour shift, if you\\'re lucky. Also it is not \"common\" and many medical staff get lenient with the proper way to ungown. Also what /u/keertus has stated.\\n\\nI\\'m a healthcare IT analyst. I sit in on a lot of meetings, technical and clinical. This has been a nearly constant discussion as of late. Because Ebola patients eject copious amounts of shit and vomit.  Which has to be cleaned up by the heath care professional.  This generally only effects people in the medical profession caring for patients or those with out modern plumbing and sanitation. I am not a nurse or a physician. I work in the gross lab. We deal with a lot of cancer and any tissue that you may have removed. The threat if Ebola, in my opinion, is very under estimated. Incubation times have not been obviously studied and it\\'s really unclear how quickly people can transmit the disease. The cdc says anywhere from 2 to 21 days. But the biggest threat is taking off protective gear. Obviously protecting yourself is important. However the protocol to remove protective gear is a bunch if garbage. Basically if you touch any protective gear that has been exposed, you should wash your hands. Most anti microbial soaps only lift germs and viruses off if your hands, they do not kill. The advantage of bio hazard suites is they have one zipper in the back where the whole suite can be removed. This is done by a buddy. Beforehand they can clean the zipper are with chlorinated disinfectant. This is what works. But it\\'s not what the cdc calls necessary . I recently got to observe a seminar on Ebola at a local hospital.  As a student nurse, my professor thought it would be an excellent experience to observe something that everybody was seeing and hearing in the news.  During this seminar, the infection control nurse ran though a demonstration of how to properly Don and remove the \"specialized\" Ebola ppe.  The demonstration was done by two veteran ER nurses. As this was going on, the nurses at the seminar kept pointing out how many issues there we\\'re with potential contamination of clean surfaces. The response from the infection control nurse was \"we will have to alter this as we go and as the cdc updates their guidelines\". Even though the potential for an Ebola infection is essentially zero for this area, that is still certainly a nerve racking statement and mentality. Bodily fluids includes saliva. A sneeze and cough can potentially launch said fluid up to 3 meters at pretty fast velocity. There are some videos on youtube with super slow mo documenting this. \\n\\nAs just people in general, although health care professionals are trained, they still have a general tendency to touch their face etc. Just pay attention to your own hands and see how many times in the next hour you will touch your face without really thinking about it. \\n\\nThat being said, Ebola is much harder to contract than the flu. It is scary considering the fatality rate is ~70% with current strain, but overall, the flu will kill more people in NA this year than Ebola by a far margin. So, get your flu shots. Being a healthcare worker who has currently been trained in donning and doffing PPE per CDC guidelines, it is damn near impossible to take off all the PPE we are supposed to wear without contaminating yourself and the surrounding area. It essentially boils down to human error. The medical staff so something procedurally wrong and end up infected. The virus isn\\'t infecting them through the gear. The doctors are messing up so that it\\'s like the gear isn\\'t there. Improper equipment removal. In their training, they\\'ll put chocolate syrup on their gloves and then attempt to remove their suits. If any syrup gets on their body, they\\'ve done it wrong. 1.) Mistakes happen\\n\\n2.) Mistakes happen when taking off/discarding all of the protective measures you put in place. They work wonders when worn properly, but they need to be taken off very carefully. \\n\\n3.) Mistakes happen when people wear too much protective clothing. So Ebola is not that contagious, you don\\'t need a full protective suit with trailing oxygen line and all that jazz. But for some reason people keep wearing them and these suits are great for protecting you, but increase the chances that you\\'ll make a mistake because of the decreased field of vision, sensory awareness, decreased tactile feel for objects, etc. Basically if you\\'re handling needles, a needle prick might be more likely to happen if you can\\'t pay attention/be aware of your surroundings. \\n\\nThe best way to prevent exposure is to only wear what you need and to know exactly how to take it off and to follow that procedure at all times. 1. put on a pair of latex exam gloves\\n2. dip your hands in paint almost to the top of the gloves\\n3. take them off without getting any of the wet paint on your skin\\n4. imagine how dangerous it is with \"invisible paint,\" i.e., if the surface of the gloves is contaminated with Ebola viruses without visible blood/body fluids to indicate that\\n\\nThat\\'s why Ebola can infect people who understand the risks while not infecting household contacts of sick people. Victims go quickly from not-sick/not-contagious to deathly-ill/very contagious, and the only people still touching them once they\\'re comatose and need their bloody diapers changed are health care personnel. In the final stages, that direct contact is *very* dangerous. And bodily fluids include everything, including sweat. And these people are in contact with, and need to handle, patients at the precise point when the disease is at its most infectious. As I understand it, if you\\'re unlucky it can only take one tiny mistake - bare skin touching something that touched something that touched the patient, for example. Or a minor, accidental tear in the wrong place in your one use, disposable garments, that no-one notices. And however professional and careful people are, mistakes and accidents always happen. Hubris. \\n\\nThe same hubris that downplayed the likelihood that it would even reach the US, the same hubris that did not adequately prepare hospitals and medical staff when it did, and the same hubris that continues to allow those coming from Ebola-infected areas into the US without so much as a check up. Also the same hubris that keeps saying \"It\\'s really hard to catch Ebola, nothing to worry about\".\\n\\nIt\\'s also really hard to kill yourself with a gun that\\'s not loaded, but that doesn\\'t mean you shouldn\\'t treat it like it is.... it is NOT difficult to contract, it\\'s actually easy to contract. Sweat is a bodily fluid that can be infectious, so can sneezes, coughs, and even saliva. Ebola can be spread from an infected person to others if the healthy person touches a surface an ebola patient has touched. \\n\\nDon\\'t believe this bullshit that this is not easy to spread. It is easy to spread, it\\'s hard to contain. In times past we\\'ve managed to contain the outbreaks, this one is out of control and keeps trying to jump out of the effected area I work for a hospital and can give you an idea. Basically our procedures have us double up on gloves and than wear usual personal protection. The difference here is after every piece of protective wear you take off you need to hand wash and/or disinfect everything. They even recommend bleach wiping your shoes even though they were covered. It\\'s about a 25-30 minute procedure. Now when you are in a rush as many nurses are you cut corners because well it won\\'t happen to you. During the acute phase of infection, the patient is highly contagious. The patient\\'s blood can contain up to 100 billion virus per milliliter. The infectious dose for Ebola virus appears to be very low (1-10 organisms). While the medical professionals take precautions, their work involve frequent contact with bodily fuild and removal of the protective gear. If you considers all these things together, you can see why medical staff die. Not really ELI5 but I hope this help. Those gowns are impossible to use perfectly, every time. If you\\'re a nurse of an Ebola patient, you\\'re spending hours cleaning up the vomit, diarrhea, and blood, etc, of the patient. You\\'re spending hours surrounded by the virus that is extremely infective, and are more at risk every second, praying that no shit particles or cough droplets make their way through the seams on the plasticky sheet that\\'s supposed to save you. Think of it like this:\\n\\nSoldiers wear a lot of body armor, and are less likely to die when being shot at than you or I, since odds are, they are well protected against most bullets flung at them... But they also have a lot more bullets flung at them on a regular basis, so are much more likely to die by being shot. The two nurses were poorly trained and equipped. Moreover they did not know he had confirmed ebola until after they had contact with him.\\n\\nThe Dr in NY was treating multiple patients in austere conditions.\\n\\nIn both cases it\\'s insane to think that when you lack training AND adequate PPE that you *won\\'t* get ebola The true question is... why has no one BUT trained medical professionals (here in the US, anyway) contracted the disease? That\\'s also your answer (they\\'re the ones with the closest contact with a person when they\\'re at their most contagious).\\n\\nAll these other explanations do nothing for your average 5 year old. As a health care professional, I see people on a daily basis wiping their face off/touching light switches/brushing away their hair/all kinds of other things with contaminated gloves. With ebola, it takes one \"oops!\" to be infected. As said before, nurses and doctors have to come in contact with body fluids one way or another. Most likely they\\'re wearing a protective suit, but when removing that suit many times they accidentally expose themselves. Ebola has very very high concentrations of virus particles.  I drop of blood of an aids patient has maybe a million virus particles.  A drop of bodily fluids of an Ebola patient has ten billion. There\\'s a neat video floating around out there in which a doctor uses chocolate sauce on a protective suit to show how easy it is to get fluid on yourself when taking the suit off. The fact that they are dealing with a person who is projectile vomiting and projectile shitting and are probably weeping from every hole or opening usually doesn\\'t help Try to concentrate very hard on your work and not touch your face a single time in the space of one hour.  It\\'s harder than you think.

You either break the part that checks in (thus making it think it\\'s legit) or you create something that makes it think it\\'s checking in at home.  An example of this would be to redirect the server request to a program you control that then says the program is legitimate, or otherwise fools the program. Extremely simplified: A game has a function *checkIfValid()* in wich something like this happens:\\n\\nif valid game return true; else return false\\n\\nA cracker would then want to replace that false by a true so that this functions never says your game is an invalid copy. The problem with that is that the code is compiled and only consists of zeroes of ones so it is extremely hard to find and change this. \\n\\nAs companies often have the same code fragments over multiple games people are able to find it faster.\\n\\nBut it is very tedious work and often consists of reading the computer memory with tools to see when which part of the memory is accessed by the game.'),\n",

       "  \"Well, its a little more weird and complex than that.\\n\\n\\nFirst, you are paying in but the people who currently need it are drawing on your funding of it.  As will you from the people who pay after you.\\n\\n\\nSecond, the politicians love to tweak things and they made a few major tweaks.  Here is one: the capped the contribution.  I believe its capped at $150,000 a year but it doesn't matter really - here is the point:\\n\\nIf you make above the cap you only pay into social security based on the cap.  So, if you make 1 million a year you pay the same as someone who makes only $150,000 a year.  \\n\\n\\nThis is an example of how people with an agenda of privatizing S.Sec. underfund it so they can argue that it is going to fail so we have to privatize it.  Self-fullfilling prophecy anyone?\\n\\n\\n**It's not really in trouble.** \\n\\n\\nThis is classic thunder without lighting - if you repeat the noise enough people will believe there is a storm coming even if there isn't.\\n\\n\\nIt will be in trouble eventually if we don't do something about how the politicians already screwed it.\\n\\n\\n**Oh yeah.**\\n\\n\\nThen there is the bit about how Ronald Reagan (R) and Tip O'Neil (D) made a deal that said they could borrow money from it.  See, its also in trouble because the politicians decided that the government could borrow our savings from us (savings that we are mandated to have to pay) even though they were never supposed to be able to do that.\\n\\n\\nHope that helps! The problem is that the baby boomers (those born during the population spike following WWII) are reaching retirement age, so we are going to have a large number of people all drawing out of the social security.  This is going to cause the ratio of people on social security compared to people paying into social security (ie the rest of us) to spike, and the current social security tax won't be able to pay for all the social security benefits that are needed.\\n\\nNow the good news is, this was completely predictable, so back in the 80's we increased the social security tax, and the program ran at a surplus.  So basically all the baby boomers were in their high income ages, and they funded enough of a surplus to pay for themselves when they get to retirement age.  Of course, then there's the bad news.  Since Congress abhors a pile of money, the government didn't actually save any of that money.  Instead it loaned it out to itself in the form of special bonds.  So other parts of the US government own money to the Social Security department.  \\n\\nNow as long as we pay back the social security fund things aren't to bad (there are other issues with social security, but they are much smaller compared to this issue).  But regardless of how it's structured, the end result is much the same, a whole bunch of people are going to want their social security, and we don't actually have the money to pay for it.  Of course this is true of all the governments debts, so it's not a unique situation.\"),\n",

This however has its problems,\\n\\n1. The US has abysmal voting rates, our populace just isn\\'t interested in politics. We\\'ve made a system that we have to use, that no one wants to interact with because it has become so vile and impenetrable. The system is convoluted and fundamentally rotten. Your average american either, \\n\\n A) doesn\\'t have time to wrap their head around everything they feel like they need to know \\n\\n or \\n\\n B) Doesn\\'t want to know because they think it all sucks.\\n\\n2. The system uses first past the post voting / one person one vote [(watch this video by CGP Grey)](_URL_0_).\\n\\n This system suppresses multiple party systems, with each person having only 1 vote, it empowers the leaders and discourages smaller groups from attempting to get a say in the system.\\n\\n **Example:** The Owl Party is fiscally conservative and the Hawk party is fiscally liberal, but supports foreign intervention. These are the two dominant parties Zylandia. A break away from the Hawk party wants fiscally liberal but is against foreign intervention. They want to vote for leaders who are like Hawks mostly, what they lack is popular vote because they are new. In First Past the Post / One Person One Vote systems, everyone gets only one vote, and similar candidates will share votes because there is a lot of overlap, so when a race is intra-party (Talon vs Hawk) it is okay. However with Interparty races people who would support the Talon party will feel pressured to vote for the Hawk Party representatives because the Hawk party has more wide spread support and without the support of the Talon party will lose against the Owl party. And Talons dislike Owls more than they dislike Hawks. Because Hawks and Talons are kind of similar, so it\\'s better to get a Hawk in than an Owl.\\n\\n In a multi vote system a Talon supporter could vote for their Talon candidate as their primary vote, and then the Hawk candidate as a second choice. In this way people get to vote for who best exemplifies their beliefs without forcing them to choose between a loser and the dominant party. Forcing all people to vote into one person gives the group of citizens who are most stubborn extraordinary amount of power; ie: religious zealots.\\n\\n3. Money, the current political system is coin operated, please insert hundreds of thousands of dollars to run for Senate Without fiscal support from wealthy donors or Super PACs many possible candidates cannot have competitive races simply because they cannot raise name awareness, hire employees, and combat attack advertisements.\\n\\n\\nFor us to have a truly representative nation for our citizens, our citizens should be able to vote for who they believe most represents themselves by both voting for the person, and voting for the political party, and for our potential politicians to work at on the same even ground. There is a reason why most of our top level politicians are from wealthy families.\\n\\n**tl;dr:** we need to organize nationally a new more important party than republican or democrat, under one agenda. That agenda is to fix the system so that it can be more representative of the citizenship of the U.S. This allows moderate and more hardline conservative and liberals to vote for their candidates without being controlled by small but powerful groups of people. The thing is, most Americans *do* like the main options for President. That\\'s why they\\'re winning. It\\'s just they\\'re not the people on Reddit, so you\\'re not hearing about it. Be active.  Vote in *local* elections instead of whining and moaning once every four years about politicians. Well, we\\'re currently in the process of 50 states and some territories worth of intra-party elections to determine who the nominees are. That kind of sounds like the opportunity to have done something about who gets nominated.\\n\\nIf so much of America is unhappy with the parties\\' nominees, I have trouble blaming anyone other than the 85% of voters who didn\\'t participate. People need to stop making such a big fucking deal about the stupid presidency and worry about their local fucking elections.  That\\'s what they can fucking do about it.

People need to know that the parties we have aren\\'t the only options. There are, in fact, many other parties out there. In other countries there are often more than two main parties vying for power.\\n\\n\\nI\\'m a little bugged when I see people complain that the party primaries aren\\'t democratic, that the rules favor one candidate or another. The parties make up their own rules, and if they wanted to make a rule that said the candidate has to have purple hair it wouldn\\'t have any bearing on the democratic government laid out in the Constitution. The parties and the government are different, it just so happens that in this country that third-parties and independents aren\\'t given much consideration.\\n\\nWhat can you do? Organize, start a new party, vote for a different candidate, run for office, vote for an independent, write-in your vote, vote for no one.\\n\\nEdit: BTW, while I stick to what I said above, I do think that some of the alleged voter suppression absolutely IS a threat to our democracy. In true American fashion, vote for the candidate that you want to lead our country. Don\\'t worry about wasting your vote.

In humans, taxis are a form of reflex. If you touch a hot stove, you move away your hand away (negative taxis).  \\n  \\nSome animals rely on this almost entirely.

They\\'ve been believed by some subset of humanity for so long that it\\'s hard to know how they started. We don\\'t know who physically wrote the old testament. We don\\'t have any direct evidence of Jesus\\' life. We tend to think that Buddha believed what he was saying and have no reason to suspect otherwise. With time (and nothing to prove them 100% wrong), religions have gained a certain place in society and beliefs have become respected. Many people \"believe in belief\" so to speak. \\n\\nThat\\'s not quite true with Mormons and Scientologists. We actually know who made both of those religions up. In the case of Mormons, their religious texts were penned by Joseph Smith, a known and convicted con artist. Once you look at the beliefs, they are pretty far out there (although arguably no stranger than most religious beliefs are to outsiders). When he claimed that only God would let him translate the new scriptures, somebody tested him by claiming that the translation was lost and wanted to see if he could reproduce his work. He couldn\\'t. He came up with something similar, but different. \\n\\nScientologists are in a similar boat, where a science fiction author (who is on record as saying that making up a religion is the best way to make money) wrote a religion that sounds an awful lot like a science fiction novel. I live near a lot of Mormons and have two of them for best friends and I can say that they are very nice people. In public. In private, it\\'s a whole other world. These are some things I\\'ve noticed and noted as crazy while being an outsider and living among them. Take my words with a grain of salt.\\n\\nBiglefttoe\\'s top 13 oddities of Mormons!\\n\\nNotice! These are my experiences and opinions! My opinions do not go for all Mormons! Everyone is different! I am not an expert of the religion so PLEASE fact check me!\\n\\n1. Magic underwear- I\\'m serious, look it up. It\\'s funny.\\n\\n2. They\\'re friendly cause they want to save your soul- Every Mormon friend I\\'ve ever had has tried to convert me. My best friend likes to leave The Book of Mormon at my place every now and then and refuses to stop. Apparently it\\'s expected of them to try and convert everyone possible, and it\\'s a lot easier when the convert-ee likes you.\\n\\n3. Holier-than-thou.- They can be very judgmental. I\\'ve seen people chatting about how much of a sinner so-and-so is for drinking alcohol while they themselves drinking a beer. I cannot tell you how many times I\\'ve seen people duck while in the liquor store because the local preacher is driving by.\\n\\n4. Doomsday survival buddies.- They are very apocalypse minded, and as far as I\\'m aware, their religion encourages it. I think they are encouraged to have a years worth of flour and a well. Not sure as to the why.\\n\\n5. History of Polygamy.- THEY DO NO ENCOURAGE IT TODAY. IT IS LOOKED DOWN UPON. In their history, polygamy WAS (past tense, not current) encouraged and widely practiced. Much less so now. They tend to get really mad when you bring it up though. It\\'s the part of their history they would like to bury, like how Germany wants to forget that Nazi\\'s ever existed.\\n\\n6. How is baby formed?- They are really encouraged to reproduce quickly. I mean married ASAP and have lots of babies. I could be really wrong on this, but I think it\\'s like have 13 kids and you get your own planet or something. Premarital sex is a major no-no, divorce, not so much. So if you see a couple get married and baby soon after, yeah, it\\'s usually to hide the first one.\\n\\n7. We\\'re on a mission from God,- and they\\'re not getting the band back together. It\\'s expected (but not required) for all men to go on a Mission (travel and convert people) for 2 years time. They will send you almost anywhere, and technology is forbidden. They can write letters and ride bikes, but no phones. Women can do it as well, but can go for a year and a half instead and tend to get sent to be more like a nun in Salt Lake City (happened to best friend number 2).\\n\\n8. South Park heaven.-Mormons go to heaven. You a good, kind, and near saintly person? No heaven for you. According to the faith, the only way to get in is to accept Mormon Jesus into your heart. South Park has this as a running joke.\\n\\n9. Racism!- Was wondering when it was gonna show up. In their book, there were three groups in the war in heaven. Satan, God, and the neutrals. God went with a \"If your not with me, the your against me\" approach and scorched their skin black for not siding with him. Thus black people were created. Black priests weren\\'t allowed until government got involved.\\n\\n10. What\\'s a Purgatory?- Despite being very easily insulted by being compared to other Christian religions, they know shockingly little of other religions. 9 out of 10 Mormons will not know what Purgatory is. This goes for a lot of religions, but they tend to be pretty open minded about learning about other religions.\\n\\n11. Sheltered Life- Everyone is a good person! This is how a lot of them view the world and I\\'ve seen a lot of them get used by other people for it. They want the perfect world and are woefully under prepared for the real deal.\\n\\n12. And so it came to pass- This line is like a joke to them. Their holy book uses this so often. A theory is their founder wanted to make his writing sound more bible-like so he did this a lot.\\n\\n13. It\\'s like a mirror!- Despite the protests of both sides, Mormons and Christians are really similar. They both see things about the other and judge them for it only to not realize their own religion encourages the same thing. Thus why Mormons are shocked when someone nice isn\\'t Mormon, and a Christian is shocked when they learn someone else is Mormon. This falls back into the \"Holier-than-thou\" bit again.\\n\\nOnce again these are my experiences and opinions. Hope this helped you to understand!\\n\\nEdit: formatting is not playing nice. Because Mormons really do tend to be genuinely nice and sweet people. That being said, they believe some really strange stuff, even from a Christian point of view. One of the best things I have seen illustrate this is the song \"I Believe\" from the Book of Mormon musical. In each chorus the main character goes through a list of beliefs. He states things that all Christians believe, then at the end of each section he says something specific to Mormonism.\\n\\nBy the way, if you haven\\'t heard it, the Book of Mormon is a brilliant musical. It pokes fun at Mormons, but in my opinion has a really sweet message after it is all said and done.\\n\\n_URL_0_ \\n\\nEdit: The last chorus is all Mormon beliefs, not general Christian beliefs. Because that is a very nice way to summarize the Mormon faith, nice but crazy.\\n\\nWhy would someone be judged more harshly for being a Mormon then other religions? Because it is a very specific sub-set (or sub-culture if you would) of Christianity. \\n\\nThink of it this way. If I tell you I am Christian, then you can only really assume I believe in the divinity of Christ. There are so many Christian faiths out there you cannot even be sure someone who calls themselves a Christian actually goes to church.\\n\\nBut if I tell you I am Catholic then that is more specific. You can safely assume that I attend church, go to mass, participate in confession, believe in the holy trinity and so on. Simply because Catholicism is a more specific set of faiths.\\n\\nMormonism is one of the most specific. If someone is a practicing Mormon then they believe in the teachings of Jospeh Smith. Now not to go too deep into but this means belief in things like the concept that when Jesus came to earth he manifested in all nations including pre-Colombus America. Combine that with some more unusual modern practices (magic underwear) and people view the Mormon faith as bit \"crazy\".\\n\\nBeing Mormon is generally accepted as believing fully in the Mormon faith, which people view as crazy. Religious zealots are often thought of as crazy Some of the finer points made by t_hab are pretty accurate.  As a mormon for 15+ years, having converted in my 20\\'s, married in the temple and currently have three children, I can say that I get a 50/50 split of people who think I am crazy and others who are \"meh\".\\n\\nA few of the other posts talked to specific incidents and give the impression all mormons are the same.  That is like saying every catholic priest is a pedophile.  I am sure there are some Catholic Priests that do good work, keep their promises/covenants and are shinning examples of what Christ would be.\\n\\nFaith is an exercise.  You think Kolob is crazy, that doesn\\'t even scratch the surface of the nuttiness in mormonism - if that is in fact what you are looking for.... nuttiness.\\n\\nI think celebrities and average joe\\'s are viewed different because we put such value in being a celebrity - like somehow, being in a celebrity means you are smarter or more worthy or whatever.  I can think of a lot of celebrities who are nuts and aren\\'t mormon.... or scientologists.... or whatever.\\n\\nUsing the South Park episode or the broadway play as a highlevel overview of mormons is like using coles notes to understand shakespere.  You might get the gist of it, but you won\\'t get anywhere close to feeling or understanding what it means to be a mormon.\\n\\nAre there crazy ass mormons?  Hell Yes.  My ward (local church) seems to be full of lunatics.  You should know, we aren\\'t all a bunch of lemmings following Joseph Smith off a cliff.\\n\\nAs a mormon, I struggle with some parts of my faith.  I bet you dollars to dougnuts we can take JW, Catholic, Anglican, Shinto, Buddhist or ANY faith - branch or pure sect - and find a good portion who attend services / \"practice\" their faith - who are in the same boat.\\n\\nI love reddit.  That said, I hate those sub\\'s who are just downright nasty - the horse sex, nasty sex, regular porn, my little pony craziness........  the list goes on.  Should we say that everyone on reddit subscribes to spaceclops?\\n\\nI believe very strongly in what I know.  I also believe very strongly that everyone has the right to say, believe whatever is on their mind.  I believe in freedom and that means allowing others to say their mind - even if it is some stupid, retarded shite like what Chikens1 said.\\n\\nAre we misunderstood?  No, not completely.  We believe in some crazy stuff.\\n\\nAre we nice on the outside crazy on the inside?  This is reddit - every religion is nice on the outside and crazy on the inside.\\n\\nAnd just for sake of clarity - mormons believe in the entire body of scriptures - not just one narrow view.  Old testament and New testament are both in our standard works.  Do we think the book of mormon is the most correct? Yes.\\n\\nIs mormonism all bubblegum rainbows and unicorns?  Nope.  The massacre in the 1800\\'s bothers me greatly.  The revelation about blacks and the priesthood at the height of the civil rights movement?  Yep, i have an  issue.  Prop 8 activity and now that gay rights has overwhelming support and in the last few months the leadership of the church is stating that gays are okay, so long as they don\\'t act sexually on their feelings...... okay.  that seems odd.\\n\\nMitt Romney was not my kind of mormon.  I saw right through him at the begining of his campaign and many wards were divided on him.\\n\\nI hate to ramble on and off topic, but I wanted to put my two cents on your question, add some backfill to give you some idea of who you were dealing with and provide some props to what I believe.\\n\\nWill you find crazy lunatics in mormonism?  No more than any other relgion.\\n\\nAre we fanatical?  If they have a temple recommend -  most likely.  Even if they don\\'t, they probably are.\\n\\nIs every mormon - celebrity or otherwise typical of what you will find every mormon to be?  God I hope not.\\n\\nDo we have some dark parts in our past we wish to be kept filled away?  Yes.  I don\\'t like the answer, but, that\\'s the reality.\\n\\nWhen I look at the good, the bad and the ugly of the faith I believe - I still believe.  That believe is probably comprised of blind faith, pure faith and a dash of hope.\\n\\nAm I crazy? I sure hope so. Dear OP.\\n\\nMormons are considered crazy because they are different than the general run of the mill Christians. They are Christians, and define themselves as such. But they also believe in the following things:\\n\\n*There is other scripture besides the Bible. The Book of Mormon. Mormons say that it was written by ancient prophets who lived in the Americas, and was translated by Joseph Smith by the power of God. Joseph is the founder of Mormonism. Mormons revere Joseph Smith as a modern prophet, but they dont worship him.\\n-There are modern prophets. In other words, Mormons believe that God is real, God knows what is going on here on Earth, and He cares enough to speak on the matter. The President of the Mormon Church is their Prophet. As far as I am aware (in my limited understanding at least) the only other Christian Church that makes a similar claim is the Catholic Church.\\n\\n-Mormons have pretty strict (to some) dietary practices. A practicing Mormon (by practicing i mean one who actually believes and follows their teachings.) does not drink alcohol, does not do any drugs (prescriptions are fine), does not drink coffee. Some interpret this as they cant drink anything caffeine. But caffeine is never outlawed in their beliefs anywhere.\\n\\n-Mormons have pretty strict laws regarding sexuality. Basically they believe its fine between a married man and his wife. But anything outside of that is a very serious no-no. Emphasis on a man and a woman marriage. Mormons define marriage as being between a man and a woman. Family is a pretty huge deal to them.\\n\\n-Mormons have a number of cultural practices that set them apart from others. For example:\\n\\n1. Many (though very far from all) young Mormon men, and some women, between the ages of 18-22ish go preaching their beliefs to people all over the world for 18-24 months. They dont get to choose where they go, the assignment is made by their prophets. Many people find these missionaries annoying. And many people think its strange for young people to go preach.\\n\\n2. the so-called \"magic-underwear\". First off, if you ask any Mormon about it, they will probably be a little offended. It is roughly analagous to calling a muslim a towel head. Second, they dont actually believe (most of them, anyways) that there is anything magic about their underwear at all. It is a religiously proscribed garment that serves as a symbol for them of promises they have made. Its a symbol, like a flag, or a cross or a crucifix. Mormons just happen to wear theirs. Thats pretty much all it is. \\n\\n3. someone else on this page said something about Mormon \"secret police\". There is no such thing. But they do like to keep track of each other. And each active member is assigned a few people or families for whom they are responsible to try and be friends with and help out if they can.

You are free to do as you like, they cant stop you.\\n\\n4. They are a tight knit group. Mormons tend to be a pretty tight community, and they can be pretty damn judgemental of anyone who does not adhere to their standards, kind of like some jewish communities. Honestly its hard to blame them. In their early history they were driven and forced out of their homes from one city and state to another. They eventually came out and settled Salt Lake City because they were forced out everywhere else. The state of Missouri had an extermination order against them at one point. That isn\\'t to say its ok for them to be judgemental, its not, and some of them are very very bad that way, but they have some reason for it.\\n\\nI could go on. But the basic idea is that people consider Mormons crazy because they are different from what they consider the norm. Mormons have pretty high standards that they are supposed to live up to. And when one of them does not people react stronger than if someone else did the same thing. Mormons have a lot of beliefs that set them apart from other Christians and which are more or less unique to them.\\nHaving said that, they do tend to be very friendly people.

       "  \"Have you ever held a can of compressed air while you pressed the trigger?  The can gets really cold. When compressed gas is released the container cools. \\n\\nImagine a loop of pipe. There is a very small valve on one side and a pump on the other. \\n\\nThe pump pressurizes the coolant. The valve creates the same reaction of pressure being released. \\n\\nSo the side where the pressure is released is cold, but the side with the pump is hot. That's why they put the hot pump on the outside (of the air conditioner or refrigerator).  And the cold valve on the inside. Imagine you have a collapsible container of some gas at room temperature, and you begin squeezing it. You're doing *work* on it, which means you're transferring *energy* into it. The only place that energy can go is into the temperature of the gas: i.e., it gets hotter.\\n\\nNow you let the outside air cool the container back down to room temperature. Then you relax your grip on the container and let it expand again. This time the gas is doing work on your hands, and the only place that energy can come from is the temperature of the gas -- so it gets *below* room temperature.\\n\\nIn the fridge, a gas goes through a compressor to accomplish the first step. The high-temp gas then runs through tubes outside the fridge in back, where the air cools it. Then it goes through a small orifice, which accomplishes the second step; then it runs through tubes inside the fridge, picking up heat from the contents, and finally back to the compressor. Lather, rinse, repeat. Engineering student currently taking thermodynamics. Fridges and freezers are what’s called thermopumps. Essentially, heat is the kinetic energy of atoms and molecules wizzing and vibrating. As long as a substance is above absolute 0, there is always heat within it. A thermopump sucks in the heat from a region (the inside of your fridge) and dissipates it in another (your kitchen). \\n\\nIn nature, heat only moves from hot to cold regions, so how does a thermopump manages to do the opposite? We achieve this by having a refrigerant substance run through a system of tubes, the substance is choosen such that it can be vaporized and liquified easily. There are heat transfers that come with the phase changes (liquid to vapor and vice versa). Last bit of science we need to be aware of  to understand the themopump is the fact that not only temperature can induce a phase change, pressure is equally important. In everyday life everything happens at 100kPa so we don’t notice it as much, but water will boil under 100C in high altitude where the pressure is lower. So our refrigerant can be boiled by simply changing the pressure. \\n\\nSo now we can get a more applied idea of how the thermopump works. The refrigerant will start as a cold low pressure liquid (colder than the inside of your fridge) that will go through long winding tubes in the inside of your fridge, sucking out the heat to undergo a phase change, turning into vapor. Then enter the compressor, the part of your fridge that requires power, to raise the pressure and temperature of the vapor. It will then go through long winding tubes again, this time on the outside of fridge (your kitchen). The vapor will liquify and thus pouring alot of the heat it gathered earlier inside the fridge, into your kitchen. The high pressure hot liquid will then go through an expansion valve (which will essentially lower the pressure and temperature). Bringing us back to the low pressure cold liquid from the begining.  Thus completing the refrigeration cycle. The pressure changes are done to change the phase change point of the refridgerant to the ambiant temperature of both regions. \\n\\nThis can be reversed to heat up a home. These systems are more efficient than traditional electrical heaters because they use energy moving heat rather than just generating it. \\n\\n\\n\\nTL;DR: They move the heat inside your fridge/freezer to your kitchen by playing with the refrigerant’s pressure and temperature and phase changes. When you compress air (Make a volume of air take up less space), you heat it up. This happens because all the energy is compressed into a smaller volume. When you decompress air, the opposite happens. This is charles law.\\n\\nSo, they take a refrigerant, compress it a lot, then cool it off with room temperature air. They then decompress it and it becomes very cold. You can do this with regular air (nitrogen, oxygen, and carbon dioxide), but it doesn't work as well. Then they run air in the fridge across the cold heat exchanger, which warms the refrigerant up.

       "  'it\\'s so bad because it does a shit job of what it\\'s supposed to do, and makes people think that being searched and having no rights when you travel is a normal thing. it should be replaced with a handful of privately hired security guards, like we had before, and who were doing a fine job. nothing the TSA does right now would have prevented 9/11 from happening, yet that is reason we\\'re given for their existence and the billions of dollars that are wasted on it. it\\'s a completely horseshit infringement of people\\'s rights, and worst of all, it does basically nothing to make us any safer. most of the people that work for the TSA are barely qualified to work at walmart. It\\'s only existed since 2001. Before that, airports hired their own security.\\n\\nThere are some things that benefit from being run by the federal government. They tend to be large scale endeavors: flying to the moon, fighting the Nazis, cross-country highways.\\n\\nUshering people through metal detectors isn\\'t something that needs the full weight of the federal government behind it. It was recently reported they miss decoy weapons or bombs over 90% of the time during routine tests conducted by the Homeland Security Dept. I\\'ll bite.  So consider this.  The general idea is that we need to screen people before getting on air planes.  Why is that?  Well, the theory is that because airplanes have a high concentration of people confined to a relatively small area, it provides a setting in which a bad actor is afforded the opportunity do something untoward (in the worst case, kill them).  Because of that, we want to screen everyone who is going to enter that confined area of high density soft targets to make sure they have no such ill intent.  Again, as others have pointed out, airport security is not new and wasn\\'t suddenly sprung upon us with the advent of the TSA.  Anyway, now we have TSA and along with that we have long lines at the security checkpoint at every airport in the world.  What this has done is basically move the high concentration of soft targets in a relatively confined space off of the airplane and into the airport itself.  There are no security checks required to get to the security checkpoint in the airport.  A bad actor can simply walk in and do his evil deed when he gets, say, half-way through the security line.  The bottom line is that we\\'ve not measurably improved security.  We\\'ve simply made a change for change\\' sake.  This is precisely what is commonly known as \"security theater\".  It gives that average person a false sense of increased safety and security while draining billions of taxpayer dollars in the process.  The things that TSA claims to do (stop bad actors through behavior analysis and detection of contraband and so on) is largely false as test after test have shown.  It\\'s basically a big social experiment that does nothing to improve safety/security, wastes money, punishes honest travelers and makes it easier for would be bad actors to inflict harm should they choose to.  The fact that there have been no such attacks doesn\\'t prove that TSA is effective, it proves that the risk is incredibly small. Airports need security checks.\\n\\nSecurity checks need to ensure security.\\n\\nTSA doesn\\'t ensure security. \\n\\nThat\\'s a good summary. yes, airports need security checks\\n\\nbut having someone paid minimum wage powertrippin\\' as they tell you to remove your shoes is not security\\n\\nit is something visible and kinda looks like security, makes Homeland Security look like they\\'re doing something and politicians always want to be perceived as doing something\\n\\nbut, what was reported yesterday as the percentage of weapons they missed?  95%?\\n\\nif the airlines/Fed were serious about security they wouldn\\'t be hiring people at minimum wage to ensure it They don\\'t find the real threats.\\nThey find lots of non threats and they end up pissing people off\\nThey are expensive as fuck...\\n\\nAnd as a further question - why do airports need security any more so than any other mass transport? The TSA is considered to be utterly terrible at doing it\\'s job because anyone who has ever had anything to do with actual security or even just airports can name a half dozen severe security failures just off the top of their heads in five minutes of interacting with them.  This has given a distinct perception that they are utterly and severely incompetent at security.\\n\\nTo the best of my knowledge this perception is entirely accurate.  Yet, to be fair, I must also admit that the TSA does a lot of stuff we don\\'t see away from the public.  It is supposedly better at those tasks, but I haven\\'t seen any evidence either way. \\n\\nThe tasks assigned to the TSA by Congress were not well defined and the entire organization was thrown together slap dash in a huge hurry.  At the time it was well known that it was being put together too fast to assure any sort of quality or efficiency.  So now the sense of dissatisfaction with the way they work is to the point where most of us think that they should be dismantled and another organization should replace them.\\n\\nKey things: \\n\\n* Any new organization has to be created by Congress and the President to be a  security agency. (TSA was pushed through Congress very fast.)\\n* It has to have the public\\'s good will and faith that they are competent to do their work.  (TSA has never actually had this, it is a post 9/11 reaction without aforethought at it\\'s finest.)\\n* It has to have a clear and distinct set of responsibilities.  (Just ask anyone at the TSA what the agency\\'s job is.)\\n* There needs to be oversight and an internal auditing system in place to reassure everyone they are doing things correctly.  (Necessary for any and all government agencies.) Bruce schneier sums it up pretty good. \\n\\n_URL_1_\\n_URL_0_\\n\\nTldr: they are ineffective and cost a ton of money. But make us feel more secure.\\n\\nEdit to add second link. I find it interesting that airports have such tight security but trains have pretty much none. Want to ride Amtrak? Show up 2 minutes before the train arrives and get on. I haven\\'t ever been on a cruise but I imagine they don\\'t have real strict security either. I guess planes are more isolated in the air but I don\\'t think that warrants the over-the-top security posture. I\\'d rather we just have more undercover air marshals than all the TSA agents in the airports. Because its staffed by people that would steal the gold teeth out of their dyeing mothers mouth. It can\\'t work. The TSA is security theater because it does not do anything to remove a threat to an airliner, they demonstrably fail repeatedly to find weapons and bombs.  There are already multiple lines of defense which will better prevent another hijacking, for instance, the cockpit doors are secured before the engines are even started, granted, this could also pose a potential risk as seen in the recent [Germanwings crash](_URL_2_) in the French Alps.  Any would-be terrorists couldn\\'t even access the controls.  Even if they could get control of the plane, there is also the fact that the passengers will not allow another 9/11 to happen, they figured it out on flight 93 before the initial 9/11 was even over.  The passengers would rush the hijackers, the plane may be lost, but another 9/11 style attack will NOT happen.  All TSA does is make people think they are more secure, while actually shifting the target to an even more open and less secure area.  \\n\\nThere is absolutely no security before the TSA line, where there can be hundreds if not thousands of people packed together in a busy airport.  Just think about what would happen in a major attack at a TSA line.  It would completely shut that airport down.  All it would take is one person with a backpack bomb to close down LAX or Atlanta.  Now what happens if you send one person with a backpack bomb to 2 different airports or three or four?  Now do that 2 days in a row, or skip a week.  Hell, make it unpredictable, don\\'t just hit big airports, go to smaller regional airports, do you really think the govt. can afford even further increased screening and major checkpoints at every little regional airport across the nation?  You\\'ve just effectively shut down all air traffic without having to set foot on an airplane, and barely inside of an airport.  The loss of life may not be as high, but the economic and societal impact would be astronomical.\\n\\nThe original 9/11 attacks took at least 19 known terrorists, years of training and planning, and an intricate coordinated attack strategy which had to get through airline security.  In the end, the hijackings were actually carried out with weapons that in all likelihood would make it through today\\'s TSA screenings.  Because of the bs security theater the TSA has in place, we have now concentrated a softer target in an easier to reach location that can be attacked by far fewer terrorists with no training other than how to press a button.  Oh, and we\\'ve spent a metric fuck-ton of money to do it. I\\'m a bit confused. I remember as a kid, before 9/11, there were some kind of security checks and bag scanners. What did post 9/11  just increase the scope of it? > Why is it so bad and what should it be replaced with?\\n\\nHoly shit, try the metal detectors and cops that worked fine before it.

Most of the American colonies were based on the plantation system that consisted basically on big chunks of land belonging to a few people, on this land they made huge farms where they only cropped one single plant (mostly sugarcane) using mostly slave labor... This made the metropolis rich but didn't developed the American (south + central) society, that's why we have this disparity today.

It's very cheap and simple to add to the water supply, and it's harmless in reasonable quantities. Fluoride is also present in toothpastes and mouthwashes for this reason. So governments around the world decided to add it to the public water supply, protecting every person's teeth and reducing pain, medical costs, disease, etc for little cost and effort. It also strengthens bones generally and protects against things like osteoporosis, although the doses in public water supplies are so low that this isn't a very pronounced effect -- usually your doctor would give you much higher doses if you needed that protection. \\n\\nFluoride at high doses can be dangerous. Fatal dosages for adults begin at around 5 grams, which is equivalent to about 5,000 litres/1,320 gallons of normally fluoridated water in one day (note the 'begins' -- if you are an 80kg/180lb man it would be about double this).

       "  'Because you can get away with almost anything in this country if you claim it\\'s against your religion.  Parents have let their children die, literally die, because they didn\\'t \"believe\" in modern medicine. Because driving is a privilege that is earned and education is a right. Compulsory vaccinations also imply the state has a right to violate bodily privacy in return for basic rights. \\n\\nNOTE: I\\'m in favor of vaccinations and believe they work. Because the US respects freedom of choice in medical matters. While there are certainly limits on this, because of some unethical physicians treating patients, we\\'ve swung on a pendulum toward patient-focused care--i.e., the patient more or less selects from a menu of options presented by the more-or-less advising but not commanding doctor. There are also religious reasons why someone may avoid vaccines, as well as allergic reasons, but that last one should be obvious. \\n\\nOn another note, the vaccines have a minimal risk to them, that you may negate by not being vaccinated. Whereas there isn\\'t any benefit to smoking or not using child restraints. \\n\\nAll that said, I wish vaccines were mandatory. They have an excellent safety record, and are probably on par with penicillin in how successful they have been. \\n\\nHowever, a very vocal minority creates a great deal of trouble in confusing the incidence of diseases like autism and usage of vaccines. Blindly thinking that the rise of two things means that those two things are therefore causally linked, they have missed the statistical fact that we\\'ve only begun to characterize autism, and therefore its incidence rises naturally. If you pay attention to something, naturally you see it more often than if you don\\'t. \\n\\nChoice is often an excellent thing. Some people think that the benignity of these childhood diseases is better than what they think the vaccines cause. However, they often miss the fact that, while the initial disease itself is benign, the disease may cause severe health problems later on. For instance, measles may cause male infertility. This won\\'t be caught until much later, and I\\'m pretty sure some men are going to be quite upset at this eventual outcome because of their parents\\' choices in not vaccinating them. ELI5: why do people keep posting loaded rhetorical questions on eli5? There is a really important part of U.S. belief system that revolves around the concept of the role of government, especially in terms of whether the government has the right to dictate individual parts of any given persons life - whether it be taxes, work-hour requirements, seatbelt laws, drinking ages, etc.\\n\\nThe idea that the government, state or federal, can mandate or require that you *must* undergo a medical treatment can seem to many a significant overstep of what government is supposed to do. It\\'s a scary thought because it would lay the groundwork for additional government-required medical treatments, regardless of a persons personal beliefs. Especially as the U.S. operates under a \\'winner-take-all\\' political system, the minority could find themselves faced with compulsory medical treatments regardless of personal beliefs. Think of the issues ongoing with pro-life vs pro-choice - depending on how the state/city government decides to swing, one of those two sides is going to have a bad time, which can lead to a lot of extended and deepened animosity.\\n\\nThis creates a rather complicated system - you want people to be vaccinated as it is important to help mitigate or eliminate the effects of infectious diseases, but you also want to respect a persons right to personal independence. Compromising one for the sake of the other can create a lot of political tension in either direction that is not easily settled.\\n\\nNow, that\\'s the federal level - at the state level, it can be easier. You have a smaller segment of the population you are dealing with, so creating legislation that deals with these issues is easier. For example, you may not be able to demand that all children be vaccinated, but you *can* pass legislation (with public support) mandating that entry into a public school system from K - 12 requires a certain set of baseline vaccinations. Not everyone is mandated to get them - but if you want into a public school, you have to get those baseline vaccinations.\\n\\nThings like child restraints or smoking age-limits had their own political turmoil during their own time periods for the same reasons - the fight between government-mandates and personal freedom is fairly constant, and depending on your ideology, not easily resolved. Because government mandated vaccines would mean that the government can legislate what can and can not go into my body, and that of my children. The government being given a higher authority than the citizens in regards to their own bodies is a scary thought. This question was just an attempt to spark a\\nCirclejerk. Stop asking loaded questions, you know damn well why. Another loaded question post, where you\\'re just making a politically-charged statement. Correct me if I\\'m wrong, but I\\'m pretty sure vaccines aren\\'t free, which would be a good first reason they aren\\'t mandatory.\\n\\nSecond, while vaccines don\\'t cause autism, unlike seat belts, they can still have negative side effects. It\\'s a general rule of thumb that anything with a potential negative effect will never become mandatory for every person\\n\\nThird, while the pros of vaccines usually outweigh the cons by a large margin, making the choice a no-brainer for many, the risk of dying thanks to not vaccinating is still a lot lower than dying in a car crash, even if you\\'re wearing a seat belt, so I don\\'t think it could be ruled as reckless endangerment.\\n\\nFourth, thank\\'s to evolving diseases, vaccines are constantly changing.  Regardless of how safe we\\'ve found our current vaccines to be, ones developed fifty years from now could contain risks we didn\\'t anticipate now. It started as a religious exemption. Some religions (i.e. Christian Science) object to vaccinations for long established doctrinal reasons. States that require vaccinations for schools made exceptions to accommodate people with religious objections, so as to not have a parent object that their first amendment right of freedom of religion were being limited in some way. \\n\\nNo religion (well, none I\\'m aware of) bars driving with a seat belt on or allowing children to smoke, so similar objections cannot be made. \\n\\nIt\\'s really only become a problem in the last few years as parents began to think that the potential benefits of vaccinations no longer outweighed the potential risks. \\n\\nNote: I vaccinated my kids. I can imagine that some of it is because not being vaccinated is a \"natural\" state.  We evolved to deal with it ourselves, and the majority of kids can fight off the diseases. However, a simple majority on your side is a shitty reason to not take precautions (a 24week fetus has a 51% chance of surviving outside the womb, but we sure as hell don\\'t allow elective c-sections that early).\\n\\nBeing in a car is not a natural state, so the argument of \"my kid was built to fight this off\" can\\'t apply when we\\'re talking about going through the windshield. Simply put, because here we have Freedom. We have the freedom not to be forced into injecting our kids with something, even if the scientific community asserts it\\'s 100% safe. On the other hand, you have many people working to take away that freedom for \"the greater good\" so we lose some freedoms when it comes to the \\'smoking age\\' and child restraints.\\n\\nIt boils down to balancing the scale of \"the greater good\" versus personal liberties. America is founded on personal liberties which is why some of us fight so hard to keep them. Because the Supreme Court of the United States has declared that people have the right to make their own healthcare decisions, and that parents are legally entrusted to make proper healthcare decisions for their children. Honestly, our government is so corrupt that the idea of government mandated medication of any kind is pretty frightening. It might go back to when individual freedoms were more important to the average American. I think vaccinations are a good idea but I think the government mandating a medicine of any kind is a horrible idea. It\\'s not a law, but where I live, the school system requires that students are vaccinated. If someone doesn\\'t vaccinate their children, they would have to homeschool them. If most people are immunized then you get something called herd immunity in a population - communicable diseases cannot spread if most people are immune even if a few are not immune, as the probability of them each encountering one another is low. So the right of the parents (religious, body rights, whatever) are balanced with the needs of the population. Other factors come into play of course - for example If parents refused to immunize their child for tetanus (relatively uncommon) it would likely be permitted, but if that child stepped on a rusty nail (dirty wounds are a huge risk factor for tetanus) a physician could (and would) invoke the power of the state and immunize the child without parental consent. When you send your child to public school you submit a record of their immunizations. If you choose not to have your child vaccinated then you sign a form saying you object to vaccines for personal or religious reasons. Schools know which students are not vaccinated for which diseases and can bar them from attending school during an outbreak. [Here](_URL_0_) is an article the NY times ran yesterday about a Judge upholding a school\\'s decision to bar students from attending Might as well put mandatory Breathalyzer  ignition systems in every car also... And install narcotic detectors in all our toilets to protect us from ourselves... Let\\'s make it so you need a licence to have a child...

And as the food chain changes, because we've destroyed a layer of the food chain, a different species may take that position and make it permanently impossible for the original species to recover.\\n\\nThe price of fish has gone up, farmed fish are helping replace that. For example, [Atlantic cod](_URL_0_) is almost impossible to buy at market. Current harvests are about 1% of what was previously caught. Same goes for haddock, red drum, and a few others. \\n\\nWhite abalone is almost extinct, in 1980, it was about $2/lb, before the fishery was closed in 1995, it was selling for almost $15/lb. \\n\\nYou should consider, it's cheaper now to grow farmed striped bass in the middle of the Arizona desert than it is to fish them in the oceans. That gives you a hint as to the scale of the problem. Let's use an analogy where you're a tree lot owner. You inherit three acres of nice maple-covered land and you decide to switch to wood as the primary source of heating for your house. Year one you cut, dry and burn the wood that's closest to the road. Year two, you have to go back in further a bit to cut more wood, so you buy an ATV and you can still get the same supply in to burn. Year three, you're at the back of the lot. Your supply is exactly the same - you get six cords of wood to burn... but then comes Year Four. You have nothing left but some small maple shrubs now. Suddenly the price you pay to acquire wood to burn goes way up.\\n\\nFisheries are the same. They completely collapse when very nearly the last schools of fish have been detected and harvested. Until then, the *current* supply is stable, and the price has to stay reasonable or people will buy something else. \\n\\nIt's only when boats start coming home empty that the impact of reduced supply will affect the price. Fish are becoming more scarce but fishermen continue to become more and more efficient at getting fish, so they are still relatively inexpensive. \\n\\nAlso, farmed fish make up about half of fish sales. If you look into the price of Bluefin tuna in Japan (a rare and overfished species) you will see that a single Bluefin can cost as much as a sports car. What's going on is that certain species of fish are readily available and become popular to eat and people buy them up and they get overfished and the population collapses. Then the fishing industry moves on to new fish. People want *fish*, but not necessarily a specific species. So the fishing industry now searches for fish via *satellite* to find large schools of fish that are deeper or further away from shore than the usual fishing locations. These are fish populations that have never been fished before so there is an abundance of them. Species like orange roughy. They continue to catch orange roughy, then one day it will experience population collapse and they'll move on to another species. They can keep doing this, while the price of fish remains cheap because as of now, fish isn't scarce, just certain species of fish that will have populations that may never recover and may go extinct.\\n\\nA second reason why the price remains low is: slavery. Increasingly, slaves in southeast Asia are used in the seafood industry.  _URL_1_ Let's say that 1000 fish are caught each month, the total population of fish is 10000, and the population is replenished at a rate of 500/month. The population of fish is obviously declining and at the current rate will eventually perish, but at the moment that has no effect on the supply of fish in the market, which is still 1000/month. i think the price of fish has risen quite a bit in the last 10 years ---halibut now at 10-12 a pound flounder at 8-9 .the popularity of farmed fish like tilipia (very easy and quick to grow) finding a market .\"),\n",

How fast you decelerate in the water is directly connected to the overall length of what\\'s entering the water; a long, narrow object penetrates deeper below the surface and decelerates at a lower speed, while a bunched up object comes to a dead halt much faster. Additionally, when you\\'re all curled up in a ball, there\\'s much less \\'you\\' between your head and vital organs and the surface of the water; as gross as this likely sounds, but in a feet-down entry your feet, shins, knees and thighbones act as a crunchy \"crumple zone\" protecting your intestines and points north. It\\'s probably a moot point if you\\'re falling far enough to shatter bone on impact, but it could make the difference between the ER and the morgue. \\n\\nAnother big part of what kills you on water impact is disorientation. Between the pain, panic and trauma people get scrambled about, lose their sense of where the surface of the water is, and proceed to swim the wrong way until they black out. Adding to the problem, if you spin or rotate on the way down or after water entry, the fluids in your inner ear can start moving in non-helpful ways, making your own body tell you the wrong way to go. Hit the water feet first, and you improve your odds of being able to process which way is up in time to make a difference. Hit it in cannonball mode, and who knows which way you\\'re going to be facing, and what the fluid in your inner ear is going to be telling you. \\n\\nAs far as the clenching, that\\'s mostly to keep high speed water from rushing in somewhere it shouldn\\'t, an incredibly painful insult on top of injury that could further compromise your survival chances. i think youd have a better chance if you go in feet first, toes pointed, with your legs tightly together, arms tightly at your sides.  with your ass clenched tight.  you want to pierce the surface of the water like a needle.'),\n",

For each ingredient, they pick a bunch of samples, test them, and figure the average amount of each material in the sample. Then, when you make something with that ingredient, you only need to figure out how much ingredient is in each serving.\\n\\nSo, given a simple ingredient, how do they figure out it's contents… There are a variety of chemical tests. Today, mostly they freeze the sample down using liquid nitrogen and grind it into a super-fine powder. To determine how much nitrogen is in it, they use a chemical technique called Kjeldahl analysis which tells you how much nitrogen is in the sample. That's proportional to the amount of amino acids, meaning you can figure rout how much protein was in the sample - and they look up on a table (calculated 100 years ago) how many calories there are per unit of protein (originally figured out in a calorimeter by burning proteins).\\n\\nFor fats, there are similar methods (using hexane instead of an acid to separate it out), and the fats have a known caloric content too. Everything left-over, calorically, is carbohydrate - again, they look on a chart to see how much a carbohydrate is worth.\\n\\nThere are a battery of tests for the presence of various vitamins and minerals. Some involve chromatography (separating the chemicals out by how they move along a film, through a chemical gradient, or by size of the molecule). Some can be done by mass spectroscopy (vaporize a sample and hurl the atoms down a tube where magnets deflect the atoms based on mass and electrostatic charge)…\\n\\nThe key, though, is that it's really expensive to do all of these chemical tests. So, rather than do them over and over, one does it to each ingredient in the product, and you fetch the values for each ingredient in a database and work out how much of ingredient you used and calculate out the calories, fats, carbs, protein, etc. that way. Necessarily, it's a gross approximation: not all fruit has the same sugar content, grains very in how much fiber vs. starch they have, but the expectation is that in the long run, the numbers on the package represent the average nutritional content one would find given the ingredients used.\"),\n",

Short excourse: In buddhism, the ultimate goal is to achieve enlightenment and break the cycle of death and rebirth. The Dalai Lama achieved enlightenment but still returned in order to help other people.\\nIn Tibetan Buddhism people who are enlightened and returned are considered something similar to patron saints.\\n\\nThe Dalai Lama is the head of the Tibetan government in exile (Tibet is still occupied by China) and is the highest teacher in Tibetan Buddhism.\\n\\nImportant to note is that the Dalai Lama is not chosen or elected, but *found*. Buddhism believes in reincarnation so every Dalai Lama is considered the same being.

The panchen lama is also a reincarnated being that has been found by the highest lamas and the current dalai lama.\\n\\nNow, the current problem is that the current panchen lama went missing 20 years ago, possibly abducted by the Chinese government. The Chinese claim that he is fine and just camera-shy, but this is met with ... scepticism.\\nThe whole point is that the Chinese would love the next Dalai Lama to be pro-China and would officially recognise Chinese rule over Tibet. So it is possible that the Chinese government abducted the panchen lama and either replaced him with somebody loyal to the Party, or indoctrinated him.\\n\\nSo the current Dalai Lama suggested that he might not reincarnate again, because \"he is no longer needed\" which is probably just a theological excuse to keep the Tibetan government in exile active. The Chinese government (officially atheist, by the way) refused this and said that the Dalai Lama has no choice over whether he will reincarnate or not. \\n\\nWhen the current Dalai Lama dies, it is feared that this might split Tibetan Buddhism between those who support the Chinese Panchen Lama and those who either support the Dalai Lama found by the government in exile or who believe this Dalai Lama was the last.\\n\\nIf this sounds weird, well welcome to the world where religion and politics meet.'),\n",
       " ('- How do good actors portray characters that are bad actors? How do they intentionally act poorly while still managing to be GOOD at acting poorly?',\n",
       "  'There are different acting methods and ways of viewing the craft, so it\\'s going to vary a little from actor to actor. I can only speak as someone who did a couple shows in high school, and who played characters who had varying skill in lying or not lying for what worked for me. If I were better researched on the craft I could tell you about the techniques professionals use, but I noped out of the field after high school, research and all. \\n\\nThe technique I used--which was mostly just me doing the same play-pretend stuff I did as a kid encouraged by \"Wow Carly, you\\'re such a good actor! Maybe you\\'ll go to hollywood when you grow up!\"--was that I tried to pretend I actually was the character and think and feel the way they felt. This was natural to me because I spent a lot of time writing stories and playing pretend as a kid, and I watched a lot of TV and had memorized a lot of the little visual things actors do to get something across. But I would just be constantly thinking about the lines, about what happened to the character before, and about how they felt now, what they were planning. And I guess my body language and voice just kinda changed to match what I was \"feeling.\" \\n\\nIn two of the plays I was in, I had to play characters who tell very big lies that screw up everything for everyone else in the play. One of the characters was a good liar, and one was a bad liar. In real life, I\\'m actually an awful liar because I\\'m not very well practiced. My good liar, though? She had a plan and she knew exactly how to pull it off, so I knew she\\'d be confident, and I know she\\'s literally did not care what it did to anyone else. I focused on what she would be feeling, on the confidence and poise and the smug satisfaction of \"you stupid SOBS have no idea\" she had going on.\\n\\nMy bad liar was really upset, and told the lie just for spite. It was so, so obviously untrue that I cannot believe any version of the character she lied to believed it. I just stayed in the place she was in, which was more or less \"HAHAHAHA TAKE THAT\" and delivered the line with the over the top rage that motivated it instead of the more restrained bitterness or even angry sympathy that would have been called for if the line were true. The character she was lying to is dumb as a box of rocks and the audience knew I was lying, so really any emotionally inappropriate delivery would have flown there. I could have acted super happy, super sad, anything extreme... as long as it wasn\\'t subtle or normal or right.\\n\\nSo TLDR, in my case, I was really good at convincing myself for a little bit that I was the character and imagining how they felt and what exactly they were thinking. If I had to lie well, I had them engage in the same process. If I had to lie badly, I focused on what they were feeling instead of what the lie should have made them feel, and maybe cranked it up just a little bit past what felt right to me. Actors who use a different process would have a different way of doing it, but the net \"output\" of having the character not act the way the actor feels like the audience would expect for a \"good\" performance is gonna stay the same in many cases.'),\n",

       "  \"Males have nipples because for roughly 2 weeks in the womb we all develop as female. After that sex begins to define itself and work on breasts and a vagina is indefinitely halted. \\n\\nNipples are only the exit hole for milk, for males to produce milk we'd also need mammary glands. Not to mention milk production is tied to reproduction, too. So males would need to have periods of fertility, like ovulating females. Keep in mind that asking *why* about evolution is always tricky. Evolution doesn't have goals, things just happen, and when they work out for the better they stick around. \\n\\nAny explanations of why a specific trait evolved are going to be limited by our knowledge and biases, in a way that's really hard to pin down. Sometimes the why is different than we expect, or hidden by some confounding variable. Sometimes the why was a relic of the past, and the trait is merely a leftover. Sometimes there is no why, and the question of one thin versus another boils down to chance. Given how scattered the fossil record is, it can be nigh impossible to explain all but the most basic traits. It probably ended up that specialization was more effective than just being capable.\\n\\nFor hunting, you either come back with something you caught or you didn't. Say that you spent half of your day stalking your prey but now you had to come back to take care of the young. If you were a dedicated hunter, maybe a few more hours hunting would mean you would have something to bring back for dinner but now you have to return with nothing.\\n\\nProducing milk also drains your energy. If you had to also hunt or gather, you won't have as much energy to do either compared to someone who is not producing milk. This is also bad if you're trying to escape being a prey to other animals. The males of the [Dayak fruit bat](_URL_0_) species will naturally lactate to feed their young.  Hard to say whether it's a result of natural selection, or something in their diet.  \\n\\nConsidering that almost no male mammals naturally and non-pathologically lactate, it suggests that this feature, if it was ever present, was lost among the earliest common ancestors of all mammals.  Lactation is an expensive trait to retain, males who have lost it would be more likely to find more females and reproduce, and if their offspring require additional nutritional support, well, there's lots of other ways the male could contribute. One of the reasons why females are more involved in aspects of child raising (such as lactation) than males are, is that females can always know who their own  babies are, since they gave birth to them, while males do not necessarily know who their babies are, since women can have sex with more than one male, and often do.  The human race does not have a biological history of strict monogamy, even though the institution of marriage was created to encourage monogamy.  The evolutionary history of the human race greatly predates the institution of marriage. Most mammals are not good father's.

How would we get the area from there?\\n\\nSuppose you had a clock hand of length r, and you covered it in paint. Assume that there is enough paint that it won\\'t run out or anything. You let it sweep around in a circle. The area it will paint is the area of a circle with radius r, yes?\\n\\nI propose that the amount of paint that the clock hand dumps on to the paper is *linear.* In other words, it does not matter where the clock hand is along its path: it paints just as much at 6 o\\'clock as it does at 8 o\\'clock or whatever. \\n\\nSo, if we wanted to consider the amount of paint it\\'s painted as a function of how far it\\'s traveled, we would use a linear function, since it\\'s a linear process. Linear functions have this interesting tendency of looking like lines, like [this](_URL_1_). Maybe that has something to do with why they\\'re called \"linear,\" better minds than me can ponder that mystery (huehue).\\n\\nWe\\'re getting close, so hang on.\\n\\nI have a function that tells me how much I\\'ve painted based on how far I\\'ve traveled. If I want to get the exact number, what I do is say \"hey, that looks like a triangle!\" and I take the area, [like this](_URL_0_). The area of the shaded region is the amount that I\\'ve painted.\\n\\nSo, suppose I trace a full circle, ie I bring the head of the clock hand from x=0 to x=2πr, which is the whole circumference of the circle. I know how much paint gets dropped when I do that, because I know it\\'s a linear function.\\n\\nWell, I know that I\\'ve swept a total distance of 2πr, so the base of my triangle is 2πr. I also know that my clock head has length r, so the height of the triangle is r. What\\'s the area of the triangle?\\n\\nπr^(2).\\n\\nYes, math. You did a good job. Good girl, have a treat. As an aside to the reader, welcome to second semester calculus.\\n\\nSo, spheres. I swept a clock hand to get the area of a circle. Could I sweep a circle to get the volume of a sphere? Yes.\\n\\nIn the same sense that I ended up tacking on an extra \"r\" when I bumped up from circumference to area, I tack on an extra \"r\" when I go from area to volume. That part makes sense, just like how the perimeter of a square is r, the area is r^(2), and the volume of a cube is r^(3). Easy.\\n\\nWhy 4/3?\\n\\nWhat I would like to impress upon you is the *power law of derivatives.* Calculus shit.\\n\\nπr^2 - >  2πr\\n\\nwhen we take something called the \"derivative.\" By doing so, I turn area into circumference. I actually did all this shit already, but now I\\'m doing it backwards.\\n\\nSimilarly,\\n\\nπr^3 - >  3πr^2\\n\\nwhen I take the derivative. Here, I\\'m turning volume into surface area.\\n\\nI know (for other reasons which I can go into if you *really care*) that the surface area of a sphere is 4πr^(2).\\n\\nSo, if the surface area is 4πr^(2), and volume - >  surface area gives me r^3 - >  3r^(2), volume must be\\n\\n(4/3)πr^(3).\\n\\nedit: If someone is curious I can try to justify the whole power law stuff.

       "  \"Because of the camera's field of view (FOV).\\n\\nIf you're a big first person shooter game player (or you know about cameras) you're probably familar with FOV. If we consider what we can see as a cone starting at our eye and expanding out like [this](_URL_0_) then FOV is the angle between the two boundary lines.\\n\\nIn shooter games FOV is often expanded by pros to gain an advantage, since it lets you see more of your surroundings. [Here](_URL_1_) is a quick example of increasing a game's FOV I googled up. The image on the left has the FOV expanded to 65 degrees compared to the default of 45 degrees on the left. With the larger FOV you can see more on the left and right. But you'll also notice that the 2 trailer things look like they're farther away even though the player is standing in the same place - that's because as you increase the FOV you also change how the light from distant objects is going to converge on your 2D surface.\\n\\nEssentially a larger FOV means that objects seem to decrease in size faster as they get farther away. The opposite is also true, if you decrease the FOV then it increases the apparent size of far away objects since they now converge on a larger portion of the view area. The camera on DSCOVR used to take these pictures has a FOV of just 0.61°. It makes it very effective at collecting light from far away objects because it is focused on a very small cone. It also means that the distance between the Earth and the Moon doesn't have the same effect on relative size as it does when taken with a regular camera or human eyes. Hold your hand in front of your face. It's probably about as big as your monitor. \\n\\nKeep your hand in the same spot and move your head backwards. Your hand now appears smaller than the monitor. \\n\\nThere's a certain distance where your hand and the monitor get smaller together, at the same rate. This is because the distance between you and those two things becomes a lot greater than the distance between those two things. \\n\\nAngular diameter depends on distance, and ratio of distances. \\n\\nBasically, the first image is very close to the moon and far from the earth,  so the moon seems big.\\n\\nThe second image is very  far from both the earth and the moon, so they appear like their actual relative sizes. So yes, the earth DOES appear smaller in the second image,  but the moon got smaller a lot faster just like your hand. DSCOVR basically had its camera zoomed in more. The EPIC camera on the spaecraft that took the image is specifically designed to observe the Earth from a distance, whereas the cameras on the Apollo missions were more general purpose.\\n\\nTo be more precise, in a camera the focal length of the lens determines the physical size of the image formed on the sensor. Then the physical size of the sensor determines the field of view, and the pixel resolution of the sensor determines the size of each pixel in the image. With analogue film there are no pixels but the film still has a resolution limit because of its chemistry and there's also a resolution limit imposed by the lens.\\n\\nFinally a large image can simply be cropped, although the DSCOVR image is in fact pretty much its full size.\"),\n",

In a nutshell, there is a marked, noticeable difference at the bottom end of price- if one shirt costs $3, and another costs $6, you're going to get more than twice the quality, all other things being equal. (For the purposes of this example, we're going to ignore things like discounts.) However, as the price goes up the difference in quality gets smaller and smaller. The difference between a $10 bag and a $100 bag is equal to the difference between a $5000 bag and a $10,000 bag, despite the huge disparity in prices. At that point, the real value people are paying for is indeed the brand name, and the social prestige that comes with it.\\n\\nTL;DR: Low-to-medium: big difference. Medium-to-high: Less. High-to-crazy: Not much. It depends entirely on what types of items are being bought and the brands of the items. For example, it's winter, so boots come to mind. On one hand, you may spend ~$40 on a pair of Apt9 boots from Kohls that will literally begin falling apart after a season or two of heavy snows. On the other hand, you could spend $100(L.L.Bean) - $300(Redwings and the like) for a tremendously more durable boot with a consumer satisfaction focused company. The Bean boots might have a ton of wear and tear after two seasons, but they will provide amazing service to maintain or replace your boots if they fall apart. The Redwings could last 15 years of you took care of them, and even longer if you had their soles replaced considering the strength of their uppers. For shoes/boots, paying for quality leather is always worth it rather than dealing with low quality reconstructed leather. \\n\\nWhen it comes to clothing such as shirts and pants, it still varies. For some reputable brands, the mark up is worth it (to a degree). Buy a t-shirt from Wal-Mart, wear it for a month, and see how it fades or stretches.

Both deal with the mechanics of sound, while one focuses on the psychology of “how” you hear, more precisely than merely “what” you hear. \\n\\n1.) Constant noise that has a relatively small amount of randomness within its pitch variation, produces what is called “Brown” noise. The name comes from Robert Brown, the scientist who became known for his work in discovering Brownian motion (particle physics). The addition of slight, context-dependent randomness is the mathematical component that was novel within his work. Each pitch is found by adding a random offset to the pitch before it, creating a sort-of upper and lower bound for the pitch to fall within, without it wandering off by accident. This noise, which has a frequency equivalent to the the reciprocal square of its energetic component (dB = 1/f^2), is stronger at lower frequencies. That makes the dull roar much louder, and encompasses enough of the audible sound spectrum to drown out a lot of bass-heavy frequencies (sounds of highways, etc). The sound dilution is, I think, what effect waterfalls or rainfall often have in terms of drowning out other noise (excuse the pun) and thereby creating a sense of comfort without intrusion from the environment... \\n\\n2.) If you really care to figure out what, beyond the sound, is happening with uniform fields of sound, light, etc... check out some writings on the Ganzfeld experiment.  The experiment involves prolonged and absolute exposure to uniform fields of color at a fixed depth, and usually a uniform field of sound as well. Interestingly, people begin to see and hear things that are due solely to their mind attempting to discern how far away the sound they are hearing, or sight they are seeing, is.  It follows that people often find the noise used in Ganzfeld experiments (white, pink, brown noise) as having an enhancing effect on concentration and creativity.  While this could play a part in calming someone, it may just as well result in someone’s mind becoming restless given too much time or space to think.\\n\\nHopefully, some of that answers your question and isn’t too far above 5 years for this sub. :)'),\n",

Well, you lose weight when you burn more calories than you take in.   Alcohol has a ton of calories, so you need to either exercise a shitload more or eat less.  \\n\\nFor example, let\\'s say you had a six pack of Dos Equis.   That\\'s 780 calories, so you need to either walk or run almost 8 miles, or eat 780 calories less to maintain the same weight.\\n\\nStraight liquor has a little less calories.  You could drink bourbon and water or vodka with diet tonic to get less calories.  Anything with coke, tonic, etc. makes it almost twice as caloric. It\\'s not so much the alcohol as it is the net calories you have per day.  If you eat the same amount of calories as you burn per day, the net is zero and your weight stays the same.  If you eat (or drink) more calories then you burn, you will start to gain weight.  If you eat (or drink) less then you burn, you start to lose weight.  So unless you track every calorie consumed, then you don\\'t really know your caloric intake and even though you eat \"well\" you still can be consuming a lot of calories.  I have lost 25 lbs since January because I track every calorie I eat and keep it under my calorie goal.  My diet includes a lot of beer, but I keep it lower calorie like becks 64, guiness, etc.'),\n",

       "  'Stagnating wages, skyrocketing cost of living, poor transportation and heavy traffic make the less-expensive suburbs very difficult to live in while working in the city.  A huge increase in tuition costs resulting in everyone in their 20s being sacked with tens of thousands of dollars of debt. Lots of good suggestions here, but most people seem to be talking about how we\\'re all worse off. Personally, I disagree.\\n\\nAn obvious one is that lifestyles have changed massively. Everyone now has two cars. The household of the 50s might have had a few luxury goods, now 8-yr olds have iPhones. We go on more holidays, to further places, and spend more. More people go to college, which now costs more. Two people working means we need more childcare, which costs more. We look down upon manual labour, but we\\'re excited for people to have Art History degrees.\\n\\nEssentially, we don\\'t live the way we used to. Yes, house prices have outpaced wages, but we spend a lot more money on a lot more crap than we used to. People used to read books, now we all have 2 or 3 consoles, cable, multiple televisions, and a kindle if god forbid we deign to actually read. You\\'re probably reading this on your phone, or tablet, or a pc.\\n\\nFight Club summarised it nicely, if you ask me - *\"Advertising has us chasing cars and clothes, working jobs we hate so we can buy shit we don\\'t need\"*\\n\\nWhat you call \\'good\\', and what the people 50 years ago called \\'good\\' - they\\'re waaaay different, man.\\n\\n(we could also discuss the division of wealth, or the population explosion, both of which are equally valid responses) People keep saying, its all the luxuries we expect nowdays that are making it seem like we have less becuse we expect more. So you are telling me that because now i have a smartphone,internet and go out to dinner once a week that all of my disposable income is going there. Please. You are making it sound like people used to just sit at home watching paint dry. People used to purchase expensive stereo equipment instead of a smartphone, they used to go to the bar instead of \"racking up data with netflix\". The younger generation isn\\'t spending all their money on luxuries that people back then didn\\'t have, the luxuries are just different. Even if we have more nowdays, you can\\'t honestly expect me to accept the fact that because i have some small luxuries that\\'s the reason i can\\'t possibly hope to buy a house anywhere even remotely normal. It has everything to do with globalization and national economic policies. Post World War II, US manufacturing sector survived. European manufacturing was decimated .  But now the competitors have recovered and now you\\'ve new competitors. And you\\'re competing with all of them at once.      \\n\\nDoing business with other nations is the key to world peace, now that too many countries have nuclear weapons. It\\'ll be foolish to pick a fight with a country you\\'re doing business with without it affecting your own economy negatively. \\n\\nHuman life became more expensive, so many factory high risk jobs got shipped to countries where value of life is cheap to both government welfare and companies being sued.    \\n\\nHigh tuition costs. No major improvement to the education system. Blue collar workforce isn\\'t being trained into white collar jobs .     \\n\\nChinese labor force(relatively debt free) is competing with American labor force (debt ridden). Initially it was blue collar manufacturing jobs, then white collar jobs and now small businesses and infrastructure. They\\'re building roads and bridges in foreign countries. \\n\\nThe rest of the planet came out of slavery and started to educate their citizens. More competition.     \\n\\nAgriculture has improved, fewer people are dying because of poverty. And many countries also got their independence from the Brits. More Indians died under British rule because of famine, since the food was shipped to Brits at the cost of Indian life. \\n\\nHealthcare is better, which has increased competition. Experienced work force isn\\'t retiring/dying and a healthy baby is born every second.         \\n\\nEasy loans have increased the property prices globally. You can work 40hours and have a family but your lifestyle needs to change. You probably can\\'t afford the same neighborhoods as a couple 40years ago.

But as demand, diversity, and required quantity increase, it\\'s bound to go up.\\n\\nBut that\\'s obviously only scratching the surface. You want to own a home? That means owning land. And that means being able to get land to own. \\n\\nLondon is a perfect example. [This is the population INCREASE of London over the past few years](_URL_0_). \\n\\n[But now look at the price of a typical London home over time](_URL_1_). (Make sure to check the years at the bottom, and sorry for image size). \\n\\nPopulation shoots up? Home prices shoot up.\\n\\nThis goes for everything, not just food and housing. More people want furniture? Well, more furniture needs to be made. But that means more factories/assemblies (and forests/materials), which needs more land. \\n\\nThat\\'s not even scratching on non-renewables. And I don\\'t mean just oil and gas. There are only so many metals, and recycling only goes so far. Yes, there\\'s a HELL of a lot of iron, but getting to it becomes more and more difficult and, yes, requires more and more land.\\n\\nTl;Dr: Rising population requires more land. We don\\'t have more land. This creates a cascading demand for land, which means it\\'s worth more, which then gets washed into the rest of the economy since every business needs land at some point in its chain.\\n\\nEDIT: Spotted a comment further down mentioning how many people avoid this issue, it\\'s just if you\\'re in a densely populated area. This is somewhat true but it goes worldwide, think through the supply chain. If you live in the Mid-West, an area with a lot of free space, and buy bananas, that came from another country which might not have so much space, given it\\'s all taken up by banana farms. Suddenly, bananas have a premium on them due to land prices due to high demand, low supply. So even though the grocer in the Mid-West has cheap land, what he\\'s buying doesn\\'t.\\n\\nThere\\'s a catch here, and bananas are a weak example, since transport is cheaper now than it used to be. But you will see what I\\'ve detailed in my post in action over the coming years. I have a friend who has a theory that it stems from (putting it bluntly) women getting equal opportunity at jobs and careers.  \\n\\nI don\\'t really know if I agree with him or not, and it\\'s certainly not a \"politically correct\" stance to agree with. But objectively, it makes sense... a massive influx of people into the job market over a couple of decades, more so than job growth could handle at the time. This means workers aren\\'t a limited commodity anymore... they\\'re in excess, so employers can pay less for them because everyone\\'s just happy to have a job. Capital has suceesfully destroyed the labor movement. Simple as that\\'s. Through propaganda they have convinced the people to vote out of their self interest and have undone the progress made in the 1880\\'s through the 1950\\'s I wonder what the wealth gap was like back then?\\n\\nThere are 1645 billionaires in the world today.\\n14.6 MILLION millionaires.\\n\\nI know plenty of people say a million isn\\'t that much anymore. But I would argue it is more than most ever see.\\n\\nHow many huge corporations are there today? and how much money do they have compared to corporations in the past.\\nand how much tax are they paying compared to the past?\\nThese would directly affect how much tax the person on the street has to pay, either directly, or indirectly through the purchases they make.\\n\\nA house in 1960 in the UK was an average of £2500\\nwith the yearly wage being around £700-£1000 \\n\\nToday the average wage is £27k\\nwith the average house price being £282k\\n\\n3 years wage to buy a house in 1960.\\nOver 10 years today.\\n\\nQuite a difference!!\\n\\n \\nOther things are being kept artificially low, so it looks like our money goes further.\\nMilk is only £1 per 2litres\\nBread is only 80p a loaf\\nEggs are £1.50 for a dozen\\n\\nWhich is near enough what they cost to manufacture.\\nThis also goes for all the sugar and cheap shit they create \\'produced food\\' out of these days.\\nIt seems like our weekly wage isn\\'t that affected by our weekly shop too badly.\\nBut if you wanted to buy quality food. You know it is out of the price range of the average person.\\n\\n\\nThere are far more other reasons, but we live in a consumer world today. Other people manufacturer it.\\nIf it wasn\\'t being made by kids in the third world, or low paid workers in the far east, we simply wouldn\\'t be able to afford it on our wages.\\n\\nThe rich have got richer, and we are living a lie of wealth, with subsidised food, and dirt cheap products, made by even poorer people, but with housing it takes a lifetime to afford, and the inevitable global equality coming in the future.\\nWhich will no longer bring the masses their cheap products.\\n\\nOur wealthy and educated will be able to compete in the global market, but our poor will face competition they cannot compete with, which will force the global poor to be on a similar level.\\n\\nIf the rich/corporations are taxed to prop up the poor, then a country could protect its vulnerable, otherwise the wealth gap will become bigger and the rich will Ayn Rand themselves away from the impoverished masses. I believe it has a lot to do with the devaluation of human labor. You may now only need one person to do multiple tasks that may have taken a team of people to do 30 years ago. Factor in population growth and you can probably picture how the supply side of labor is in excess, which in turn creates a cost decrease in labor. Now, this idea only works if you assume non-skilled labor. I do not believe skilled labor is feeling the \"change\" you mentioned, and if they are its probably because of a change in what we consider \"supporting a family\" means. In addition to the other factors mentioned, it\\'s not true that in the past one person could support a family.  In the mid-20th century, while the husband may have been the only wage-earner, the wife usually worked full-time in the home, cooking, cleaning, and raising the children for no pay.  These days, families with two working parents often spend most of one person\\'s salary to buy these services.\\n\\nGoing back further in time, many of the older children in the family would also be working full-time jobs rather than going to school.\\n\\nIt may seem like we haven\\'t gained anything with the two-worker household, but we have: it means more choice and self-determination for women, and better education and less exploitation of children.  (And despite appearances, households *have* become wealthier too.) People like to try to find one reason, but in reality it\\'s almost always more complicated than that. Housing prices alone have seen a ton of growth. Here\\'s a graph that has some price changes from 1980-2016:\\n\\n_URL_3_\\n\\nIf you look at the last tab that shows real growth, The US costs have inflated 14% in real terms, with a lot of the major cities growing 40% or more. Real terms meaning inflation adjusted, as this is ELI5. So, for something that may have cost you 25% of your take home pay in 1980, you\\'re now paying 35% for the same house. \\n\\nThe other variable to consider her is that these percentages are based off median household income. In laymans terms, as more women joined the workforce, more money went into each household, and even with that happening, housing costs continued to rise. Effectively, we\\'ve worked harder to pay more, at least partially.\\n\\nConsumerism is another major factor. Put simply, you probably buy a lot more shit than someone did 30-50 years ago.\\n\\nA third major change was the factor of productivity. This tends to be the most politically fueled subject of the bunch. I started typing a big example here, but there\\'s no way to start without going on for longer than I have. In short, technology has allowed a single person to be significantly more productive, which changes profit payouts from employees to shareholders. \\n\\nThere are probably a lot of other valid reasons too, but these are the biggest three I can think of off hand.\\n\\nTL:DR; Your house costs a lot more than it used to, you buy too much stuff, and you\\'re significantly underpaid relative to your value 50 years ago. When? If you look at it historically, very roughly:\\n\\n1) before the industrial revolution, you busted your ass working the fields 24/7 to have food on the table, and if you were lucky enough to live in a feudal society, most of it went to your lord\\n\\n2) during the industrial revolution, you worked 10+ hours in factories under terrible conditions\\n\\n3) that leaves us with say, the 20th century (and only in certain countries), where 40 hrs/week would allow you to get by, which historically is just a blip on the radar. If, for instance, you lived in the rural USSR, food shortages and general goods shortages were still common, so 40 hrs/week and a comfortable life was not universally true.\\n\\nObviously during each and every one of these eras there were certain classes of people that were exempt from this, but that was always a tiny minority of the population. So to sum it up, I don\\'t think your statement is really true except in the view of recent history. At one time, successful companies passed their profits on to their employees. Modern business practices favor getting employees to work as cheaply as possible. \\n\\nSo the CEO makes 25 million dollars a year, plus bonuses, and the employees have all been fired and replaced by temps making close to minimum wage. The reason is NAFTA destroyed our blue-collar economy.  It made it possible for corporations to exploit developing countries unregulated work forces, which American plants can not compete with. They opened the floodgates to outsourcing and now that domestic workforce which defined our country post WW2 is almost entirely gone; there are still a few industries like steel manufacturing/fabrication, aeronautics, agriculture, and firearms, but even those jobs are being snuffed out by China\\'s vicous maniplution of it\\'s currency. The TPP and TTIP are the final nails in the coffin of the American middle-class, and that is why we are seeing so much bi-partisen blow-back and the elite attempting to fast track it.\\n\\nNAFTA and TPP is great for the people who own and run the companies; profit soars as American workers are laid off, and the CEOs, mop up all the money that would have otherwise gone to their employees. The economy does not reap any of the increased profits either, because often times the international coorporations shelter under tax-havens overseas, vis-a-vis the panama papers. Globalization.\\n\\nTwo generations ago, knowledge was sequesterable.  The people who had it (the West) kept it to themselves.  If you wanted to learn engineering, you had to go to a western university.  If you wanted to be a doctor, the same.  And, it was similar in almost every top profession.  If you wanted to do anything to a top-degree, you had to pay someone in the West to learn how to do it.  So, the people getting educated used to be almost entirely Westerners.  All the best jobs were in the Western World.  Etc...  The West had an absolutely MASSIVE competitive advantage.\\n\\nNot anymore.  Nowadays, if you want to learn anything - you go to the internet.  Knowledge isn\\'t sequestered anymore.  Anyone can get it.\\n\\nWhen you want a bedside table, you can get a $25 one from China.  50 years ago, you pretty much had to get one hand-made for you, at 10x the price.  But, we can only do this now because wages are so much lower in China.\\n\\n50 years ago, you couldn\\'t just ship your factory over to China to take advantage of the cheap labor.  Now you can - and, not surprisingly, all the factories have left the Western World (for the most part). \\n\\nIn fact, nowadays, you can do just about anything - just about anywhere.   So, wages in China/India/etc... will be rising (compared to American wages) as more factories move there.\\n\\nWe used to be able to get away with paying ourselves 50x what the same laborer in China was making.  We can\\'t anymore.  Wages in the First World and equalizing with wages in the 3rd world (and everywhere else).  \\n\\nThat\\'s why the West has been getting poorer for decades now.  The advantages we used to have over everyone else are pretty much gone now.  Luckily, we still have a huge economic advantage.  But, over the next few decades, expect everything to get worse for Westerners and better for everyone else.\\n\\ntl;dr:  The West used to have humongous barriers-to-entry and a lock on knowledge.  Today it\\'s slipping away (and has been for decades now). Low/no skill labor in the US does have it much tougher today. Much more of the world is industrialized and automation has progressed rapidly; so a lot of blue collar jobs are now competing with global labor and also with technology. That has put massive downward pressure on manufacturing wages, and has eliminated altogether a great many manufacturing jobs.\\n\\nToday we also have computers, smart phones, internet access, hundreds of times as much entertainment content, MRIs, a great many new drug therapies, much more complicated vehicles, many more vehicles per person, much larger houses, air travel for the masses, a much more varied food selection, etc...\\n\\nSo we have more to spend money on, and people at the lower end of the economic ladder have less money to spend on everything. The good news is the upper middle class and rich portions of the population have exploded. That is cold comfort when you are not in one of those groups though. Something to chew on... In 1975 the Fair Labor Standards Act set the exempt from overtime level to $23,660. It\\'s remained there for 40 years thanks to the 1%. All the money that would have gone to our families and communities instead went to the 1%. This was always supported by the Republicans. Shame on Democrats for letting it languish.\\n\\nPresident Obama will issue an Executive order in December of this year raising that number to $47,476. Adjusted for the Consumer Price Index, that number should be $106,003. Sorta starts to focus the economic picture we have.\\n\\nInterestingly, looking at what\\'s considered the poverty income level for a family of four is $23,550. Boy, that\\'s JUST UNDER the federal exemption from overtime of $23,660! I wonder if there\\'s a correlation!\\nIt\\'s just sad that our legislators have allowed corporate interests to quite literally run over the American middle class and flush down the toilet. \\n\\nThere is no question in my mind that we have become a corporate state owned by the 1% (or now the 0.1%). Elizabeth Warren and her daughter wrote a book about it.\\n\\nThe basic premise is that families have taken their second income  and have gotten into bidding wars with each other and driven the price of basic living items higher. Housing being the prime example but also things like daycare and education.\\n\\n[Two Income Trap](_URL_4_) Your question is based on a strawman. It is absolutely not true for almost everywhere in the US.  Some places yes...most places, no.  \\n\\nI know plenty of 40 hour a week single income families that have boats, take vacations...you name it.\\n\\nThey don\\'t live in SF or Manhattan apartments. I could write a book on all the reasons it\\'s hard to support a family today than it was in the 80\\'s and earlier. But I\\'ll summarize with this:\\n\\nCompanies don\\'t give a shit about you. At the end of the day they\\'re about making money and they can only get so far by making good products and services people want. At some point they need to maximize margins and to do that they condense, cut costs, and slow wages. Labor is generally the largest source of operating costs so it\\'s the most attractive opportunity to exploit. \\n\\nThe government grossly underestimates cost of living because they\\'re willfully ignorant to how expensive life is. Just look at food stamps. To qualify for assistance like food stamps you have to truly be living in a hell whole of depravity that makes you question why you\\'re even alive. The reason is because the cost of living index heavily influences interests rates and seeing it for how depressing it really would benefit people and not businesses and banks, which as you know, own congress. \\n\\nThe housing market is in shambles. The quality of infrastructure in America is godawful. Homes are not up to code, large building are falling apart, and everything from our sewers to roads are in a state of disrepair that fails to meet regulations in more ways than you\\'d think possible, but this only benefits the people and would cost corporate America billions. \\n\\nIt\\'s not about you and me, it\\'s about padding the pockets of the top and making life more manageable for the average person (the vast majority of America) would be too expensive. So we stay poor and starved, too weak to do anything about it. 2 main factors at play\\n\\n1) Wages have stagnated while the price of necessities have gone up.\\n\\n2) People buy more stuff they don\\'t need.  Average house size has gone up.  Unnecessary electronics cost more.  No one truly needs a data plan. We spend less time on food preparation and so we pay more for \"convenience\" I think that it should be required on this thread to indicate your age. I am 56. I was born in 1960. My father worked and my mother stayed at home. We had one car, which we kept until it died. We had one TV, which was black and white until we eventually bought a color TV. There was no cable bill. We had two phones. One upstairs. One downstairs in the basement (where Monsters dwelt). Both were leased rotary phones wired to the wall. We paid a monthly bill for our phones. Long distance phone calls were incredibly expensive so when we called long distance, which was rarely, we kept it quick. We drove for our vacations. We did not fly. Hardly anyone flew. We ate out once a week at an affordable sit down restaurant. I did not have a computer, a phone, or a game console as a kid. No one I knew had expensive stereo equipment. We had single unit stereos that were cheap. Medical care was less expensive. But people died more from medical issues. Gas was cheap. Our mortgage was my family\\'s largest expense by far. It was why all the other things stated above were true. The bottom line was that people were frugal. Coffee was out of a pot. Starbucks did not exist. Track your income. Control your spending, as your grandparents did. People largely nickle and dime themselves into living paycheck to paycheck. Live the life your parents lived at your age, not the life your parents live now. Oh, and max your retirement savings. The economy simply adapted for families with 2 incomes.\\n\\nNowadays, with women working we have an extra income in the house, but we also have extra expenses like a babysitter or a kindergarten for the kids, money spent on frozen food because the woman are no longer at home all the time to cook (which is cheaper than buying frozen food), women that work mostly likely will have an extra car to go to work (additional expenses), etc.\\n\\nThis type of economic adaptation is also seen when people that live alone get a raise. For example, let\\'s suppose that your salary is 5k USD/month, but next month your boss decides to make your new salary 6k USD/month.\\n\\nAt the end of the first month after the raise you will probably be happy to see how most of those extra 1k USD will still be in your bank account, but a few months later - after you adapted to your new income and lifestyle - I\\'m sure that the amount of money left on your account in the end of the month will be basically the same that used to be before the raise. You are assuming that what was true 50 years ago was also true 100 years ago. Most people weren\\'t supporting a family on a single paycheck from 40 hours of weekly work a 100 years ago. The value of real estate is just like the value of everything else. It\\'s worth as much as people are willing to pay for it. One of the biggest problems where I live in Southern California and other places where real estate prices are high is that super rich people from places like China are coming in and buying up everything as rental properties and paying cash. This lowers the inventory of available real estate and thus supply and demand drives up the value. It creates this extremely unfair playing field where regular folks who have saved get outbid and out priced. So much rose-tinted googles and tear-jerking on here.\\n\\nIncome levels in the US are higher today than they were through most of the 20th century. It\\'s true that in the past 20 years income levels have stagnated, but they are still higher than in 1990. This is an overly exaggerated way to describe today\\'s economy. Most families in the US are not in a position where both spouses have to work full-time just to support themselves, far from it.\\n\\nIt\\'s true that inflation-adjusted median income levels have stagnated since the 1980s (though they did not fall) and for that you can blame - if you chose to do so - globalization. If you don\\'t want to blame anyone, you go out and get a useful skill-intensive degree and reap the benefits of today\\'s knowledge-based economy. Like the wealthier Americans have done to much success. A variety of things changed but a major factor is the expectations of what you should expect from life. People needed less money in the past because they had lower expectations of standard of living compared to now. \\n\\nThings a family in 1970 didn\\'t spend money on: computers, video game systems, multiple cars, personal tvs, multiple phones, cable tv, and probably more that I can\\'t think of offhand. Wealth accumulates upward and the social safety net was dismantled beginning in the 80s. Without a significant check to their power, the rich continue to get richer while leaving the rest of the country behind. The Reagan revolution has bankrupted America. That\\'s why. Trickle down economics didn\\'t trickle down.  Globalasation/Offshoring of manufacturing jobs.  Population increasing more than the number of high paying jobs.  Accumulation and stagnation of wealth. Work went from meaningful and worthwhile to \"pay me enough to scrape by and I\\'ll be your slave.\" A lot of issue to cover here, but a few easy ones to name  led to the decline...\\n\\nThe abandonment of the gold standard is one. When our currency was based on a rare metal it was much harder for the dollar to be manipulated. \\n\\nReturning the Panama Canal was another. The canal helped feed the coffers that helped Goverment run. It wasn\\'t a huge hit, but it did take away our abality to control a powerful trade route. \\n\\nPoor trade agreements hurt a lot.  We as a country couldn\\'t really compete with countries that subsidized the cost of thier manufactured goods. \\n\\nThe implementation of a minimum federal wage under valued labor is some parts of the country, over valued labor in others. Before a federal minimum wage, local markets controlled the price of labor. Pay too little and no one would work for you, pay too much and not be able to afford the price of labor.  The cost of labor was tied the cost of living in a more dynamic sense. Now, wages in some parts of the country are too low, and in other too high. Instead of the town/city/state basing pay off of a local scale, it is now tied to federal requirement that ignores a local market. \\n\\nThe growth of Goverment. This is a big issue. A major issue. This simple example of how poorly the Goverment spends money is a little old, but should give you a fair idea. No Child Left Behind. For every dollar collected in taxes, on average, 14 cents made it back to the schools. A lot of waste in the Goverment. Too much.\\n\\nThe rise of the welfare state. Very simple to explain. We support people who can not support them selves. The Goverment raises taxes to pay for it, people make less take home money, more go on welfare, more taxes are collected to pay for the increase of people on welfare, more people make less take home money, go on welfare.... Wash rise repeat.... Compounded by how bad our Goverment spends money. \\n\\nFederal grants and loans for higher education. So stupid that no one really sees this. Every single year the Goverment increase the amount of money it gives in grants and loans, the cost of higher education is increased to take full advangte of the increased amount of money the Goverment is willing to grant or loan. Have watched this happen for 18 years. No one says anything at all. \\n\\nThe rise of the 4th branch of Goverment. The regulator branch. Businesses spend billions to comply with regulations every year. That is money that could be used to hire more people. \\n\\nInsurance for every thing. Once insurance became mandatory, it no longer become affordable. This is very apparent for the current health care insurance we are now required to carry. \\n\\nTax law. Needs reform.  When a majority of people in the country don\\'t pay any taxes at all, we have a problem.\\n\\n\\nI think the biggest single factor though is probably the stupidity of the American people over all. We have become a society that doesn\\'t respect debt and intrest. Very few seem to know how to live with in their means. Wealth is built over time, but requires spending wisely and only when really needed. \\n\\nThe average debt most Americans carry has soared in the last 15 years. \\n\\n\\n\\nEdit: spelling I\\'m going to assume you live in the U.S. and break down the major points into ELI5 versions.\\n\\n1. Productivity of an employee has gone up roughly 60% in the U.S. since 1980, but compensation for that employee has gone up less than 10% in the same time period.  Additionally there are far less barriers to trade between countries than there used to be. Think of it this ELI5 way, the economy and individual employees are producing many more things you can buy, but not providing any additional compensation so that you can buy them.\\n\\n2. The debt burden on an individual is much higher than it used to be.  Essentially, the cost of cars, houses, and education are much higher now than they used to be.  [This website has a really good breakdown.](_URL_5_) Several factors have made them more expensive over that long period of time; union wages, more modern regulations for safety that prevent shortcuts, etc.  But the biggest factor is probably the difference between Need and Luxury.  A lack of education, a house, or a car places you in a fundamentally different strata of U.S. society.  You will be treated negatively for not having them.  That they represent \"Gateways\" to social success (like getting married or having good income) makes people need them more than iphones and fine dining.  ELI5: You want those things more so you will pay more for those things and the sellers know it.  Medicine had the same problem for a long time (buy me or die) but isn\\'t growing as fast now that the Affordable Care Act has passed.\\n\\n3. Social mobility, or the ability of a person to change what level of income they live on, has nose-dived in the U.S.  The reasons are difficult to untangle: its a combination of the stratified education system, the high cost of the high end, and a reliance on a social network within the different strata to navigate them.  ELI5: If you are lower middle class, you don\\'t know the business version of secret handshakes among the upperclass that let them recognize each other, and they don\\'t know yours.  The result is our social classes act almost like rival tribes that avoid each other and don\\'t like to let members of the other tribes in, especially when it comes to employment.

Energy can come from carbohydrates (sugar is a carb), protein, or fat.  \\n\\nCarbs are sort of the most basic way of storing energy in a living thing.  They include sugar which your body can use for energy really easily and starch.  Starch, (sometimes called a complex carb) is one of the main ways that plants store food for later.  It is not a lot more complicated than a bunch of sugar stuck on end so your body can turn it into sugar to use pretty easily.  If you chew on something starchy like a pretzel or a dry noodle it will start to taste sweet.  There are also *more* complex carbs like fiber that your body can't use for energy but are good for you for other reasons.  \\n\\nProtein is not made out of sugar and is more complicated than sugar.  It can be used for energy like sugar but is a little more difficult for your body to use so you get a little less energy out of the same amount of protein compared to sugar or other carbs.  Protein is also the stuff that you are made out of so you need to eat some of it even if you have enough carbs to use for energy.  You don't need that much protein though even if you are growing fast or building muscle so a regular western diet should have more than enough protein in it.

It is pretty easy for the body to use and it has more energy in it for the same amount compared to carbs or protein.  Because it has more energy in it and because it doesn't mix with water it is easy to eat a lot of energy from fat.  Because of that some people try to avoid it.\\n\\nThat is how we use energy in our bodies.  The other stuff like vitamins and avoiding sugar or other carbs is more complicated. How much you store your own fat is pretty simple, it is how much energy you eat compared to how much energy you use.  The hard part is controlling how much your body wants to eat and sugar and fat have a lot to do with that.

       "  'The medical and science communities are still not sure exactly *why*, or what causes our bodies to flag something as an invader that it previously hasn\\'t. When we develop an allergy can be affected by many variables, including genetics. If you have an allergy prone parent, you\\'re 40% more likely to develop allergies. If both of your parents have allergies, you\\'re 70% more likely. However, you may not have the same allergies they do. \\n\\nAllergies are a response of the immune system to what it sees as an invader. The circumstances have to be just right for the allergen to trigger an allergic reaction, so the first time you\\'re exposed to cats you may be fine. The 17th time, you may be fine. The 70th time, you may be fine...but then the 71st time you have a reaction. It begins with exposure. Even if you\\'ve inhaled an allergen many times before with no trouble, at some point, for some reason, the body flags it as an invader. During this particular exposure, the immune system studies the allergen. It readies itself for the next exposure by developing antibodies, special cells designed to detect it. You are now \"sensitized\" to the allergen.\\n\\nThen, the next time you\\'re exposed to the allergen, your immune system kicks into action. The antibodies recognize it. That triggers the activation of special cells called mast cells. These cells are responsible for the symptoms in the lungs, skin, mucosal linings of the sinus and intestinal tract. These mast cells burst open, releasing something called histamines. You may have noticed allergy medications called anti-histamines. These are meant to block these histamines, thus alleviating the symptoms they cause. \\n\\nThe amount of exposure matters as well. If you\\'re allergic to, say, strawberries or avocado, you may not have a problem with a spoonful of guac or a berry or two. But then you eat a third berry, or another chip with guac, and you notice your eyes watering and itching, or perhaps hives raising on your arms, or even begin having difficulty taking a deep breath. This is because histamines cause inflammation. \\n\\nSometimes you outgrow an allergy. And sometimes people don\\'t react as strongly to the allergens that have given them problems in the past as they age. It\\'s thought this is perhaps because our immune systems weaken as we age and therefore doesn\\'t produce as strong of a response. But they never go away on their own. And some allergies will get worse over time...especially true with things like latex allergies and allergies to bee stings. There are also cross-affective allergies, where certain proteins shared by two separate allergens can cause a more severe reaction (for example, eating a banana during ragweed season). \\n\\nIt\\'s important to treat allergy symptoms, despite the temptation some have to \"tough it out\", since leaving them unchecked can cause more severe problems to develop (like asthma).'),\n",

       "  \"There are three main thin-screen display technologies: Liquid Crystal Displays, Plasma Displays, and Light Emitting Diode Displays.\\n\\nIn these are a couple of subcategories (I'll go through them one at a time): \\n\\nLCDs\\nis the LCD lit from the side or from the back, and using a compact fluorescent lamp (CCFL) or an LED array (LED LCD, usually sold as LED).\\n\\nPlasma\\nare the cells self colored, or do they use phosphors for color rendering?\\n\\nLED\\nis the display's pixels made from silicon transistors, or organic light emitting diodes? (OLED)\\n\\nIf you're lost, stick with me for a minute, let's explain what those mean.\\n\\nAll displays use between 2 and 4 subpixels for each picture element (the normal is three: Red, Green, and Blue), which combine to form the color of one square on the screen.\\n\\nLiquid crystal displays work on the principle of light called polarization.  Long story short, polarization can be used to create a light filter.  In front of each pixel is a small bit of liquid crystal that can either polarize the light or not.  When it polarizes the light, the light will be blocked by the next layer, which is a passive polarizer.  When it doesn't polarize the light, the light goes through.  And if it partially goes through, it filters out some of the brightness, running from black to white.  The liquid crystals respond to an electric charge to change the amount of polarization and create a shade of gray.  Color filters over each of the subpixels change the shade of gray into a shade of color.  Since the liquid crystal only filters the light, a light source is needed, either a CCFL or an LED panel behind or along the side of the display.  This is a major simplification, but that's the essence of what the liquid crystals do.\\n\\nPlasma\\nPlasma is a state of matter, where a gas has so much energy it begins to glow.  By trapping small amounts of gas in glass cells and electrifying them for a specific amount of time, I can make the glow and control how bright they glow.  When they glow, they either emit colored light (red, green, or blue) to make up sub pixels, or they emit invisible light that is absorbed by a coating, called a phosphor, on the surface of the cell that then glows a specific color.\\n\\nLED\\nLEDs are little electronics that emit light when a charge of sufficient voltage is passed over the diode, because of some very specific bits of physics.  The light the LEDs emit are very specific in color, and therefore are color tuned, with one LED for each sub pixel.  In large, stadium size displays, full-size LEDs can be used, while it's difficult to make minature LEDs for a flat panel display.  So, organic LEDs are used instead, which use chemical elements that can be painted onto surfaces to make the little LED.\\n\\nStrengths and Weaknesses:\\nLCDs: Typically are the least expensive type of display to make and therefore buy, but suffer from high black points (greyish blacks) because of imperfect filtering, and poor color reproduction, especially from off-angle viewing (because of the way the filter works).  LED backlights help with the color reproduction problems, and other technologies such as TFT IPS LCD technology help increase the off-angle viewing, but cost more.  LCDs can operate at high frequencies, like 120 or 240Hz, and work well for 3D displays for that reason.\\n\\nPlasma: These give true blacks and deep color reproduction, but have fixed frequencies of 50 or 60Hz, suck back a TON of electricity, have a scan pattern (which will make them flicker when filmed), and are very heavy.  They can be expensive to purchase.\\n\\nLED: OLED is a new technology and only found on some phones, primarily, and larger LED displays are usually expensive to build; in the future, OLEDs should give consumers the best of both worlds - the low power and high speed of LCDs, with the true blacks and wide color gamut of Plasma.\"),\n",

IMAX is roughly equivalent to 12-18k. Digital cinema projectors are currently at 4k\\n* IMAX projectors have a contrast ratio between 3500:1 and 5000:1. Christie\\'s 4k projector is 2100:1. This means that the difference in brightness between the brightest bright and darkest dark is 2x better for IMAX\\n* film stock can have it\\'s own visual characteristics that some directors really like (see Quinton Tarantino).

       "  'Merging companies (and yes, non-profits are companies) requires a lot of work. First, just because two companies do the same thing does not mean that they could merge easily. What if one is a Catholic charity, and the other is non-religious? Is the new charity religious or not? Which of the two Presidents is going to be in charge? Are you going to fire a bunch of staff? If not, how is it more efficient to have 1 big company with twice as many workers?\\n\\nCompanies merge when it makes some financial sense. Since non-profits are not in it to maximize value, they don\\'t have to worry about being the biggest and best. Because most these non profit charities actually rake in a lot of money that goes to CEOs and higher ups. They aren\\'t about to lose money like that. The simple answer is that they don\\'t become more effective by merging. Mergers of all kinds tend to cause bloat within companies. Non-profits rely on being nimble, quick to act, and flexible to changing needs and conditions. As they become too large, they are less able to do all of those things.\\n\\nAnd then they have larger infrastructure to maintain, which takes money away from where it is needed. I was talking to a well to do person who wanted to found a charity that did what the Red Cross did. I asked her why she didn\\'t make a donation, volunteer or apply for a job. She didn\\'t want to \"work for another organization\". She wanted to be the CEO.\\n\\nIn this case, it was her personal ego and desire to have her name be on the marquee. higher-ups won\\'t get most of the money that\\'s used for \"administration\" That would require a lot of profit sharing for the lawyers and executives. Charities more proficient at throwing celebrity endorsed, wine and cheese events aren\\'t going to share their spoils with the smaller outfits holding three legged races at a park.\\n\\nAbove all it\\'s about paying the bills and lining their pockets. Whatever is left over goes to build wells, cancer research, etc. Corruption is a big one, lots of charities run at the minimum spending to be called a charity and you don\\'t know which ones are/to what degree profiteering unless they show you their books. I work full time for a not for profit organization so I can tell you my point of view.  I\\'ll try to explain why your question, to me, sounds a lot like \\'why don\\'t all grocery stores and restaurants of the world merge together to be more efficient and make more money\\'...\\n\\nThe biggest reason is that we often we have different \\'specialities\\'. For example one might be very adept at mobilizing students as volunteers; or be very specialized to deliver programs to a specific audience (specific age group, type of community, etc). Everything in the organization (staff, resources, mentality, values) etc could be geared towards that. Trying to merge might end being like trying to merge a restaurant and grocery store.... it might not really be more efficient. \\n\\nAlso I\\'ll add that most NFPs I have worked with are really driven by the passion of the people working there, and that has to be considered a resource, too. Where I work, and pretty much any other NFP that I have had the inside scoop on, we make a lot less money than if we worked in equivalent jobs in the for profit sector. So we are motivated by different things than money. Often it\\'s the belief in our cause or a love of the methods through which we work towards our cause. I\\'m motivated by our program and all its side benefits (the personal growth our volunteers go through) as much as I like the outcome of our work. If my organization merged with another one that used a totally different approach and I lost that aspect of things, I might not stick around for my job, which I think would be a loss for \\'the cause\\'. I guess I\\'m just trying to give another example of another benefit of having different means to the same end... motivating people / harnessing their passion is important for NFPs because salary is not going to cut it (even more so if your are working with volunteers)! \\n\\nThrough my work, I often meet people who work/run other not for profit organizations with similar goals. Usually we explain our organizations to each other and then we try to see if we can partner. For example I might be able to provide a pool of trained/keen/screened volunteers to deliver a resource that they have created but don\\'t have the manpower to deliver themselves. Whenever we create a new program, we look carefully at what already exists so that we don\\'t duplicate anything. I think everyone finds their niche and develops their expertise accordingly. Sometimes I do encounter smaller group that have just started a new program that is really similar to what we do, and I feel they are reinventing the wheel (often students... who had a good idea and didn\\'t take the time to research if other similar programs existed). I usually offer to bring them under our umbrella, sometimes it works, but sometimes running their own thing (as volunteers) is their motivation so it\\'s important to them to continue on their own. When you are working with volunteers, the time they donate is a scarce resource (like money) and if they\\'ll donate more by having ownership of their own initiative, then it might be more efficient to let them lead their own thing.\\n\\nAnyways, I don\\'t think it\\'s a bad thing overall that we don\\'t all merge together. A little healthy \\'competition\\' is a good thing like it would be for any companies. We are all competing for funding from government, corporations, and individuals, and it makes us try harder!\\n\\nPS. It really frustrates me when people say that NFPs are ways of lining their pockets. I know there have been some bad apples but there are bad apples in everything. Where I work and any other organization that I hae first hand knowledge of, our salaries are very low compared to what we would make in industry, and the CEO\\'s salary is extremely reasonable. We are audited every year and there are a lot of regulations in place by the government (in my country anyways). I\\'m really sad that some bad apples are giving a bad reputation to the sector and potentially hurting us all.'),\n",

Negative growth is strongly correlated with widespread unemployment \\n\\n2.  Related to number 1, we know what to do to if economic growth fails.  We can run deficits, or lower interest rates.  It's one of the few aspects of the economy economists have done a pretty good job figuring out.  \\n\\n3. It's a good measure of the maximum a country and its government can 'do.'. It started when the US joined WW2, as the government needed to know how much industrial output they had, so they could figure out how much could be directed to the war effort.  Today, tax revenues are strongly correlated to GDP.  More GDP means more tax revenue, which means more things like school books without taking away from anything else.  \\n\\n4. Related to the above, it is a pretty good measure of how much 'stuff' is out there.  And I like stuff.  I have a lower-middle class lifestyle, and I hope my daughter has opportunities for a better lifestyle.  If there was no economic growth, her better lifestyle would be at someone else's expense.  \\n\\n5.  Because of all those reasons, it gets a lot of attention for secondary reasons.  People looking at mortgages or who own homes like to know what interest rates are doing.  People who own houses and stocks like to know what they are doing.   Politicians promise X and expected GDP growth influences if they're going to be able to keep that promise.  So it gets a lot of media attention.  \\n\\nAll this said, we need to view it critically, and realize it doesn't tell the whole story.

       "  \"I think your question may be confusing an instrument's own tuning arrangement with the idea of many instruments being in tune with each other.\\n\\n**INTERNAL TUNING ON AN INDIVIDUAL INSTRUMENT:**\\n\\n'Tuned in fourths', or fifths, probably refers in this question to the tuning arrangement of bowed string instruments commonly found in a symphony orchestra - the violin, viola, cello and double bass.\\n\\nThe four strings on a violin, viola or cello are each tuned a fifth apart. A 'fifth' is a musical interval. A musical interval is the difference between two different pitches, i.e. how much higher or lower one is from the other. The strings are tuned a fifth apart to allow a wide range of possible notes. This arrangement is traditional; other tuning setups are of course possible.\\n\\nThe double bass is tuned with each string being a fourth apart from its neighbouring strings. This is because it is a physically larger instrument than the others. Different notes are produced on each string by pressing on it, reducing the length of the bit of the string that is vibrating (and therefore producing sound) and as a result making the sound higher.\\n\\nBy pressing on the string you can only shorten its vibrating length and thus only make the sound higher. If two strings are a fifth apart, then responsibility for all the notes in between falls to the lower string.\\n\\nOn a double bass, the places on the string that you must press to produce the different notes are far apart because of the size of the instrument. Therefore it is physically more convenient in terms of handspan, reach, speed, etc. to have the strings spaced more closely. \\n\\nThat is why the double bass is tuned in fourths when the violin, viola and cello are tuned in fifths.\\n\\n**TUNING ACROSS AN ORCHESTRA:**\\n\\nAn orchestra is not tuned in fifths - this is a mix up of terminology.\\n\\nAn orchestra is tuned to one reference pitch, which is typically a 'concert A', which is the name given to a pitch of 440 Hz (or sometimes 442/443 Hz in other countries).\\n\\nWhen each instrument plays their version of 'A', they must all sound the same / match up, otherwise the orchestra will sound out of tune. \\n\\nWhen you hear an orchestra tuning up, each player is making small adjustments to their instrument to make their 'A' sound like the standard 'A', which is traditionally given by an oboe as that instrument is loud and difficult to adjust.\\n\\nEach instrument with multiple places to produce sound (e.g. four strings on a violin) will use one string to get the standard 'A', and then will tune the other strings in relation to the 'A' string. As you can imagine it takes a lot of effort to tune a piano, with 88 different places to produce sound, as opposed to a trumpet, with one.\\n\\nI hope this post explains the difference between tuning an instrument with itself (internal), and tuning an instrument in relation to another instrument (external), along with the other issues of understanding implied in the wording of the question. Why not?\\n\\nI'm not a double bass player myself (only bass guitar), but I figure the double bass *should* be tuned in fourths because if it were a wider interval, the player wouldn't be able to reach far away notes.\"),\n",

Right now there are innumerable rules limiting what companies and people in different countries can and cannot buy from each other. Trade agreements try to get rid of some of these rules.\\n\\nWhy is this good? Because when you can sell to more people, you can make more money. There is also some orthodox (meaning accepted, not necessarily correct) economic theory that says that tariffs create a deadweight loss. \\n\\nNone of this is new, the WTO (previously GATT) has existed for ages with the purpose of reducing trade barriers. \\n\\nWill this lead to more jobs going abroad? Maybe. More likely it will hurt low-skilled workers in countries that are better at high skilled things (I.e., if your country decides to specialize in high finance and Internet startups, its going to suck for your welders). \\n\\nInvestment: These are the rules that let companies \"sue\" governments for losses. Basically, this is fine for the U.S. but can suck for developing countries. These rules basically say to countries \"if we build a factory in your country, you can\\'t just take it for no reason.\" Developing countries (and developed ones) actually do this from time to time, so the idea is that by promising not to just randomly take shit, countries will attract more foreign companies to invest (ideally creating jobs, paying taxes to the government etc).\\n\\nFor companies, it\\'s good because they get to invest in booming countries like Indonesia without as much risk that an irresponsible government will nationalize their money and kick them out on a whim.\\n\\nThe problems with this are that 1 sometimes countries need to up and seize private property and 2 foreign investment isn\\'t always as good as it looks in theory (generally developing countries covet foreign investment).\\n\\nIn any case, most of the investment protections probably are already contained in other treaties. The U.S. has loads of bilateral investment treaties (look up BITs UNCTAD I\\'m too lazy to link on mobile). So does China. Japan does not have the same sort of investment protection regime, but the again most people seem to consider Japanese politics relatively stable.\\n\\nSo there\\'s your TPP. There\\'s definitely some problems with it but the people who are losing their shit appear to be unaware of any of the developments in international economic law in the last 50 years. \\n\\nEdit: I forgot IP. A lot of developing countries don\\'t have very strong protections for copyrights, patents, etc. American brands would probably like to see fewer rip offs of their products. Noe one knows what the benefits are because the entire thing is a secret. The details are not allowed to be released until 4 years after the law is signed into law. If this were so beneficial to the people of these nations then what reason would there be for it to be a secret? The simple answer is that there is no reason to keep it secret except to screw the common person. Greater economic reliance on other countries. In the early 50s France, Germany and the Benelux countries signed a trade agreement called the ECSC (now known as the EU) which aimed to not only create a common market but also to prevent future colossal wars like WWII. With greater dependency on other countries, there can be an inevitable decrease for the desire of armed conflicts. People touched on it but did not really spell it out.  The problem with lowering tariffs on other countries is that it makes it possible to have goods made cheaper overseas than if they are made at home, due to the lowered import tax.   So if we remove the tariff on electronics made in Thailand for example, then tech companies can have their tech built in Thailand for a lower cost (when labor and/or materials are cheaper).  If the tariffs remained in place then it would be harder for a company to justify sending the jobs overseas.  Labor is mad about the trade deals because they almost always result in lost jobs for working people in the US.\\n\\nTrade deals are also usually only focusing on how the tariffs will help out the biggest of companies.  But Americans are actually a \"small business\" centered economy, contrary to popular belief.  So when trade deals don\\'t really take into account how their changes in tax code and tariffs will effect small companies they can potentially severely damage a very large sub-sect of our economy.  You can see how this would anger both people on the left and right, which is exactly what is happening.\\n\\nEdit:  Oh and to answer the original question /U/okofosho probably summed it up best.  Trade deals intertwine countries so that conflict would hurt everyone. In the most basic sense, free trade is about lowering or removing tariffs, which are taxes that countries charge on foreign imports. Companies that sell their products in foreign countries obviously want tariffs to be as low as possible, and so they generally support free trade. Every country has these companies and that is likely where the support comes from.'),\n",

These camps will try to show why faking the moon landing is beneficial to the REAL world government, or why taking out JFK was what will steer us to a dystopia or an alien invasion.  \\nThis is not to say that I don\\'t believe that governments and powerful people don\\'t do shady shit.

But these sort of conspiracy theorists try to tie all the shady shit together as one narrative instead of just realizing that throughout history there have been thousands of totally independent power-brokers all trying to accomplish their own limited goals. Here\\'s the story - at least the one I was told.   Millions of years ago, a species of dinosaur achieved sentience and a high degree of technological sophistication.  They detected the meteor that would be their doom, and formulated plans to cope with the disaster.  Some fled to space and settled among the asteroids between Mars and Jupiter.  Others dug down into the earth to wait out the countless centuries.

       " ('What was the evolutionary advantage to having women be physically weaker than men?',\n",
       "  'It was more an evolutionary advantage to have stronger men. The men are generally more disposable (1 guy and 100 women can make a lot more babies than 1 woman and 100 guys) and thus were used to protect the women. The stronger men survived and reproduced, the weaker men died. However, as the women were not fighting, strength was not an evolutionary advantage for them. To expand on what the robbob009 has said, men tend to be stronger because it\\'s a more efficient allocation of resources and because it offsets sunk costs. There is something of a problem in evolution called \"the cost of males.\" This refers to the fact that in most species, most males have few or no offspring and others have many (high variance), while almost every female has as many offspring as she feasibly can (low variance).  If fewer men can get the job done, why do equal numbers of males and females persist? One answer is diversity: sexual reproduction offers increased genetic recombination, which is adaptive. Additionally, in social animals such as primates, one could argue that the increased size and strength of males confers benefits that enhance the fitness of their social group (group or kin selection). Edit: also worth adding to this list is that women engaging in strenuous physical activity while pregnant can put the baby in jeopardy, whereas the commitment of males to reproduction in many cases ends at conception.\\n\\nIt\\'s important to note that when answering evolutionary questions, legacy is a huge factor. In many species of animals, females are larger and stronger. These \"decisions\" aren\\'t made on a species-by-species basis, rather this is just something that has worked for us and our neighbors on the tree of life (be it just primates, mammals, or even including our proto-mammalian reptile ancestors...this isn\\'t exactly my field). At some point, though, the factors I mentioned above were enough to place some ancestor of ours on this track and we\\'ve had until now no reason to reverse this system. Men evolved to be stronger, not women to be weaker. \\n\\nMen and women are complimentary individuals; men have evolved to be the \"provider\" and the woman the \"nurturer\".

       "  'The other answers so far are incorrect - try putting a baby in an autorefractor and let me know how that goes for you. ;)\\n\\nFor babies or nonverbal people, we can use something called a **retinoscope**. Basically we shine a light in the back of the eye and move it around, and based on how the reflection moves it tell us if you are far-sighted, near-sighted, or have good vision. If the reflection moves when we move the light, we know you have a refractive error and which one it is (far- or near-sighted). We then place different-powered lenses in front of the eye to \"neutralize\" or stop the movement. The lens that does that is your prescription.\\n\\nWe can also use the same technique to determine if you have an astigmatism.\\n\\nSource: I am an optometry student. \\n\\nEdit: Since a lot of people are asking why don\\'t we just make this standard instead of the \"Which is better, 1 or 2?\" thing we do:\\n\\nThe answer is that retinoscopy is a *bit* less accurate than the regular \"1 or 2\" technique, but it can get us very close. The \"1 or 2\" is done to fine tune the prescription and make sure the patient is comfortable with the correction.\\n\\nEdit 2: If the 2 options the doctor gives you look the same to you, it\\'s perfectly acceptable to say so. \"They look the same\" is a valid response. Awesome question! (I\\'m a pediatric optometry resident)\\n\\nSo for children too young to give us a reliable subjective \"1 or 2\", we base the prescription on objective measurements. We can objectively measure their refractive error with retinoscopy (as mentioned above). That\\'s when we shine a light in their eyes  and use lenses to determine the prescription. It\\'s very versatile, and we don\\'t need a machine so it\\'s perfect for kids. They can do anything (eat, watch tv) as long as their eyes are open for us to get the measurement.\\n\\nIn kiddos, it\\'s best to do this when they\\'re dilated because the dilation drops force their eyes to relax their focusing/accommodation ability (which they have a lot of). Kids can accommodate through far sighted prescription/refractive error. Prescriptions for kids under 7 should almost always be determined with dilating drops. It\\'s normal to be a little far sighted when you\\'re young, and as you grow up you tend to become more near sighted. \\n\\nAs pediatric optometrists, one of our greatest worries is amblyopia or lazy eye. That\\'s when a child either has an eye turn, or high prescription leading them to favor one eye over the other. The non-favored eye doesn\\'t develop the proper connections in the brain to see 20/20 because the kid will always favor his \"good eye\". That\\'s why you\\'ll see some kids wearing an eye patch. It\\'s to force them to use their \"bad or lazy eye\" so the brain can recognize and developed clear vision through that eye. It\\'s important to treat lazy eye when they\\'re young while the visual system is still malleable. They use a machine called an autorefracter. It projects an image onto the retina, rapidly changes the focus, and uses a camera to look at the retina and see when the image of focused correctly by the patient\\'s eye. I took my son to All Children\\'s in St Pete. They used a type of computer modeling to determine how to correct his vision problems after they completed the basic, physical eye exam. The tech measured different aspects of his eyes then the doctor was able to simulate his vision based on those measurements. \\n\\nFrom there, the doctor was able to take out a set of sample glasses and set them to what would be his prescription. Then he\\'d put the glasses on his face and see how he\\'d react. He kept making minor changes until his eyes no longer crossed or turned in.\\n\\nWhen the doctor finally got it right, he tried to take the glasses off my son and he grabbed at them. He threw a full fledged temper tantrum because he wanted the glasses back immediately. It made that much difference in what he could see.\\n\\nThe doctor said that children with severe vision problems almost always reacted that way when they got it right. That\\'s one of the ways he could tell that the glasses would work. I was younger then 5 when I got mine. The nose prints on the tv were a clue for my parents. There is a machine that can project an image on your eye and look through the pupil to see the image formed on the retina at the back of your eye.  It makes the image out of focus in a specific way and observes the eye lenses attempt to focus it.  With that measurement it can make a sharp image on your retina, and from that measure your prescription without you doing anything.\\n\\nI\\'m not sure that\\'s a good thing, or what people are doing, but it\\'s possible. Some eye ailments are very obvious. I was born with crossed eyes (strabismus) and had corrective surgery at a few months. I was wearing eyeglasses before I could walk. \\n\\nI still need to wear glasses, but my eyesight is very good. You would never know my eyes used to be crossed. The question I have is why are younger and younger children wearing glasses? Is the eye sight of the human range getting worse for some reason? Sometimes it\\'s not about something besides not being able\\nto see. For example my little brother has a really bad lazy eye and when he was about 6 months old he had to start wearing glasses to help correct it. When he takes his glasses off his left eye stops looking forward at you and starts looking at 7\\'oclock and he can\\'t move it or control it. But put the glasses back on and the eye drifts back up. It\\'s odd. Pediatric Ophthalmologist here:\\n\\n1. Retinoscopy method described earlier is correct. With some skill, knowledge and experience you can be very accurate and certainly more accurate than asking a young child to refine his refraction with \"which is better\" type questions. \\n\\n2. How do we know to check?  Every child that comes into my office for any reason gets a full, cycloplegic (dilated) eye exam with refraction, no matter the reason for being there. You would be shocked how many times I have to convince parents who brought their child in for pink eye or a stye to let me do the full exam with drops and I find something unknown and unexpected.  Also vision screening from outside sources (pediatricians or schools) has gotten quite sophisticated and picks up many things earlier than they used to. \\n\\n3. Do young children need to correct their vision?  Sometimes. I will accept small amounts of myopia or astigmatism without correcting early while explaining to the parents that glasses are likely coming \"down the road\". But larger amounts or particularly  significant asymmetry between the two eyes is something that if uncorrected can lead to amblyopia (the brain not developing normal vision from one or both eyes) and will usually be corrected as well as refractive problems in the setting of other eye problems like crossing of the eyes. I got glasses when I was 6 months old. My older brother was diagnosed much older when he would refuse to sit anywhere but a few inches from the TV when watching. So, when I was born my parents saw signs they recognized from him and they just knew. Things like stuff not registering to me from far away. I don\\'t know how they knew what prescription I needed, but that was how it happened with me. Been wearing some form of corrective lenses for 23 years since. I got glasses when I was in 1st grade. At my eye exam, they showed me a cartoon and looked at my eyes while I watched it. Of course, this was back in 1981ish, so methods have probably changed dramatically. Ooo there\\'s folks who specialize in pediatric optometry, but most drs can do the basic stuff.  Checking that the eyes are working together, that they can see their parents face, that they\\'re able to track and follow etc.  I use an interesting thing (babies don\\'t see a lot of pen lights) to get then to pay attention and then watch how they fixate.  There are cards with pictures that get smaller and smaller, like with little cars or animals or basic shapes.  The tumbling E or C pointing in different directions.\\n\\nMost offices have an auto refractor or retinascope.  Specialist offices might use a fancy EOG machines and  whatnot.  Any test that doesn\\'t require subjective input.  There are cards with contrasting bands of light and dark strips of different thicknesses vs a boring all grey that the baby looks at (they look at the more interesting side)\\n\\nThere are red green glasses you put on the kid and make then trace a path through a colored dot field they can only navigate if both eyes are working together.  There are vision tests to check depth perception (You might remember having to look at a 3D fly and grabbing the wings as a kid) babies can do that.  \\n\\nWe have to do these things to make sure that the kids use both eyes together.  What can happen is they end up letting one eye better than the other and that other eye gets neglected and never develops as well.  There\\'s this critical period we have to hit or it just turns out. The top comment is correct, but I want to add that little kids often wear glasses to not just correct they\\'re vision, but keep their eyes straight.  \\n\\nWe all do two things when we look up close - we change the curvature of our lens inside of our eye to focus up close, and we turn our eyes together to fuse onan image up close.  Some kids have this drive to help them see far away, which can cause an eye to turn inward, which is called esotropia. An eye that is not straight will not develop the same vision potential as a straight one.  As an ophthalmology resident, I\\'ll give glasses to a kid to eliminate this drive altogether to help straighten the eyes.\\n\\nSo it\\'s not that kids are seeing worse and need glasses at an earlier age, it\\'s that we are trying to fix ocular alignment. I had a head injury that damaged my vision at 2. I\\'ve had glasses since I was 4. At 3, eye specialist used a pediatric eye chart (shapes and symbols instead of letters) to see what my vision was.

Closing your eyes does not, however, increase the actual acuity of hearing. I have very bad eyesight.  My hearing gets really bad when i\\'m not wearing glasses, since I have to concentrate more on what I\\'m seeing.\\n\\nMy mates laugh at me when I say, \"I can\\'t hear coz I\\'m not wearing my glasses\". I would say it has more to do with attention. Humans are very visually oriented, so we tend to place a lot of attention of visual information. If you think about it, when you close your eyes you are not only limiting visual input, you intentionally focus your attention on auditory information. In the brain, attention can function as gain modulation. When you focus you attention on auditory, you boost the relevant neural circuitry, causing your hearing to seemingly improve. The benefit of closing your eyes is that there is less visual information to *distract* your attention away from audition and back to vision. I\\'m not sure about closing your eyes and immediately having increased hearing but I grew up needing glasses and never getting them. I was pretty much blind. I relied on colors and vague shapes when looking at stuff up until I was 14. I used my ears and nose for pretty much everything else. 23 now and I\\'m constantly hearing things others can\\'t and I\\'m able to sniff stuff out very easily, even when others can\\'t smell anything. I\\'m no dog, but there is truth the the whole \"weak senses give room for you other senses to become stronger.\" Either that or I was born really lucky. Minus the worthless eyeballs. This same theory can also be applied to other senses. As a former drummer, some of my best practice sessions were when I focused only on the sense of touch with both earplugs and huge over-the-ear sound isolation headphones (to try to block out as much of my sense of sound as possible). The brain works in some very interesting ways. It doesn\\'t improve your hearing it allows the brain to focus on hearing.  \\n\\nTry this, blind fold your partner, then put ear plugs (noise protection) in there ears so they can\\'t hear.  \\n\\nThen using a soft dry paint brush very slowly paint their exposed skin.  \\n\\nThis type of sensory deprivation forces the brain to only focus on the brush sliding on the skin.  It can be a very intense experience for many people. It takes time. A whole lot of precious time.\\n\\nWitches used to suspend themselves in a \\'Salem\\'s Cradle\\', a leather cocoon in which they would shut off all five senses, to open and empower the 6th.\\n\\nI\\'ve heard.\\n\\nBut it took a few days, so they would essentially \\'shut down\\', and even then, their hearing didn\\'t improve; they were simply more aware.\\n\\nOver a LOT of time, your senses fill in the voids in the same way Natural Selection gives webbed toes to the dumbass frog that keeps being eaten.\\n\\nThough I never understood how the eaten frog would tell it\\'s babies to grow webbed feet. When you close your eyes and focus on a sound, your brain uses top-down control to filter out irrelevant information. In other words, you voluntarily put more attentional \"resources\" into processing the important information and ignoring the not important stuff (e.g., background noise, visual input, etc.).\\n\\nYour overall hearing ability does not change, but your sensitivity to sounds is affected. Closing your eyes reduces the amount of irrelevant, distracting information meaning your brain can focus more on processing the relevant auditory information. If you\\'re super interested, signal detection theory shows how one\\'s sensitivity remains the same while their \"criterion\" can shift. It\\'s not instant but over time it improves if you practice doing it.  I have some vision loss and I now rely more on sound and I have been hearing things I never heard before. Everyone is bullshitting, so let me give you a scientific answer:\\n\\nIt is not completely a placebo effect. Your hearing could improve because you can focus on it more when not distracted. People like to bullshit that they can multi-task, but empirical research shows that is impossible. Multi-tasking always reduces the quality of the activities you do; saying \"listening to music while doing my work helps me\" is a placebo effect. But the exception is a small percent of the population (like 0.1% iirc) who do **better** multitasking (the research was cool. They showed that these people drive safer while using a cell phone).\\n\\nNow, this is only for closing your eyes for a while. If you become blind, then your hearing physically improves. This is because the part of your brain that deals with hearing takes over the defunct visual part. We know this from brain scans of newly blinded people Actually, your hearing can be improved because of what you can see in several cases. This is usually called the \"Cocktail Party Effect,\" where you can focus in on one conversation while not paying attention to all the white noise. Some researchers have called this a form of selective attention (which it is), but it can be explained more simply by the fact that you can to see the other person\\'s mouth move!

Closing one\\'s eyes might make someone feel like they are hearing better but what they\\'re doing is actively listening to what\\'s going on around them. \\n\\nHowever, most people with hearing problems rely on visual cues to aid in understanding.

       "  'If you\\'re interested in the why, then we need to do some physics.\\n\\nThe first big difference is in how we get the nuclear fuel and how we make it release energy. In traditional reactors there are two basic processes:\\n1) An \"enriched uranium\" cycle. Here we make fuel by \"enriching\" uranium (keeping fissile U-235 and discarding useless U-238), and we fission it with low energy (called \"thermal\") neutrons. \\n2) A \"Fast Breeder\" cycle. Here we make fuel by turning U-238 into Plutonium, and then we fission the plutonium. To make the U-238 absorb neutrons, we need to use high energy (\"fast\") neutrons. \\n\\nBoth approaches are unfortunate because they make it really easy to make nuclear bombs. An enriched uranium cycle can only use ~0.7% of the uranium, which isn\\'t good. Fast breeder cycles have to form plutonium, and so form a lot of long half life nuclear waste (search for TRU or actinides). This is bad because then we have to store it somewhere. Using fast neutrons also means that the structure ends up more radioactive, which makes it harder to decommission a site. Fast reactors also tend to be more unstable, in that there\\'s less stuff slowing the neutrons down and moderating the power output.\\n\\nIf we use thorium, then instead what we do is turn thorium into uranium-233 by getting it to absorb a neutron, and then we fission the uranium 233. What\\'s really nice about this process is that we can turn thorium into uranium using thermal neutrons. So we don\\'t have to use high energy neutrons. Because we fission uranium getting TRU waste requires that an atom *fails* to fission both as Uranium-233 and Plutonium-239; this is rare and so we don\\'t form much long life waste. Since the overall process requires 2 neutrons, and the fission of U-233 emits about 2.2 on average, this cycle also emits far less neutron radiation.\\n\\nThe really nice thing is that thorium naturally comes in only 1 flavour, which is the one we need. So we can use all of the thorium (which is itself around 3-4x more common than uranium), instead of only a tiny fraction, or needing to use a fast breeder. There\\'s no excuse to be handling plutonium or running enrichment facilities, so it\\'s harder to build a bomb. It\\'s not impossible, but due to the way the process works the Uranium-233 tends to get contaminated with uranium-232. In the reactor this doesn\\'t matter at all, but for bombs it\\'s a really big problem.\\n\\n\\nNow, all of this applies just as well to taking a \"traditional\" reactor and running it with thorium in it. Often when you hear about \"thorium reactors\", what people mean is a \"molten salt reactor\" using a thorium fuel. In this case there\\'s quite a bit more going on.\\n\\nIn a molten salt reactor, we replace the standard fuel rods with a fluid; normally a mixture of lithium fluoride and beryllium fluoride. Then we dissolve the fuels (thorium and uranium-233) in this fluid, normally as their tetrafluoride salts. The basic reason to do this is that fluoride salts are chemically unreactive (unlike metals), and have have very high boiling points. So there\\'s never any pressure inside the reactor, which means that we don\\'t need to have large pressure vessels. This means the reactors are much smaller and easier to shield or bury. It also means we can go to higher temperatures than are feasible with a steam cycle, which means better efficiency and new possible uses (like making hydrogen).\\n\\nWhere it\\'s really awesome is the safety side. When the fuel is a fluid, it can be removed from the reactor really quickly to a safe holding pan if anything wierd happens, or if the temperature in the reactor goes too high. An accident like Fukushima is thus much much harder to imagine, because if the temperature goes too high the fuel is moved from the reactor (where it\\'s encouraged to fission) to somewhere where it\\'s not. Furthermore, fluids expand when they warm up. So if the reactor warms up a little, the fuel expands and so there will be fewer fissile atoms in the reactor, which tends to reduce power output. As a result, these reactors are intrinsically stable when the power output changes, or if there are bubbles in the fuel (whereas, say, Chernobyl was not; if the cooling water started to boil it *increased* its power output... which is what caused the accident).\\n\\nIt also turns out that with a fluoride fuelled reactor, it\\'s not too hard to remove the fuel from the lithium-beryllium-fluoride fluid, and then separate the fission products and other short lived waste from the reactor. What this means is that instead of forming lots of long lived waste by \"cooking\" short lived waste in neutrons for a couple of years, we get it out. Some of it is medically very valuable, which is a bonus. For everyone else, the point is that we end up with \"waste\" that\\'s less radioactive than uranium ore after 200-300 years. Whilst that\\'s still quite a while, we understand how to build a structure that lasts that long, and how to mark it so that people will know what it is in 300 years. It also turns out that the quantities of waste involved are tiny. For the UK, if we got all of our energy (electrical, petrol, the lot) from thorium we\\'d need a couple of swimming-pool sized containers to store a few centuries worth of waste.\\n\\n\\nOverall, these thorium MSR\\'s or LFTR\\'s are really quite cool, and at least a couple of countries are interested in them. India has had a thorium program for a while, because they have quite a lot of thorium; the US used to have one at Oak Ridge, and both China and Japan seem to be getting programs started. They\\'re much safer, their waste product can\\'t be made into bombs, and we\\'ve got a shitload of the fuel just sitting around. The fuel is more abundant, they produce less nuclear waste and it is harder to make weapons from the waste.\\n\\nPerhaps most importantly, they give us an opportunity to design a reactor from the ground up using modern materials and techniques, instead of relying on aging 1960s technology.'),\n",

But let\\'s assume that you\\'re cool with that, because motherfucker, we all need heat, some of us don\\'t live in a cabin by the woods, and yeah, heat is necessary.  \\n\\nBut then, you need to pipe that natural gas, which has been demonstrated to leak in multiple studies, releasing a shitton of methane and similar molecules, which are far more potent greenhouse gasses than the stuff we just talked about burning.  But, you gotta break a few eggs to get an omellette.  \\n\\n\\nThen there is the fracking process.  Drill thousands of feat underground, pump water to break the shale, and then introduce a drilling mud and slurry that renders the shale porous enough to channelize the gas back towards the well.  None of this necessarily leads to contamination...unless...\\n\\n\\nYou don\\'t cement your well correctly to account for water tables in the region.  So your drilling mud (full of crazy chemicals) and your fracking liquids (full of crazy chemicals) can intrude on the local water table from underneath.  This is a terrible deal.\\n\\nBut let\\'s say that we learned our lesson, we get independant review of some sort to account for the local underground water table.  We make nice pretty 3D GIS maps of the region.  \\n\\n\\nWe allow the companies that do frac, to store all of those pumping fluids above ground in lined retention pools.  Which would be cool, if the first few companies hadn\\'t shirked on their due diligence to properly line those ponds.  Most them didn\\'t shirk their duties, but some budget saving operator didn\\'t give a shit, and the fracking chemicals migrated into the local aquifer.  \\n\\nAnd that wouldn\\'t be such a terrible big deal, one water table in one place.  But the gas boom targets entire shale formations, so dozens of companies are RACING to exploit the resource.  So over a large geographical area, you are increasing not only the seismic activity of a region, but you are increasing the statistical liklihood of damage occurring. \\n\\nAnd we could protect ourselves if natural gas companies weren\\'t using trade secrets laws to shield the public from the knowledge of what kind of chemicals are in the slurry used to frac.  This was made possible by an economic concept called regulatory capture, wherein a company capitalizes on funding a political process and favors to facilitate a result that is aberrant to the market place.  Just look at the housing/banking crash of 2008 to understand why government fucked up every chance they had to substantively help the most people.  Any imbalance of information between consumer and producer creates a market distortion because consumers are unable to properly calculate the price of the goods they purchase.  You see this happen all the time when you go to buy a mattress, or a coffin  &  grave, or healthcare: they know more about everything than most consumers, and so can warp the value system by which a person would be able to judge their purchasing.  \\n\\nAnyway, because of regulatory capture, most states allowed companies to pump chemicals underground and store them on the surface of the ground without having to disclose exactly what those chemicals are.  So no safeguards nor medical expertise could even begin to address a public health issue if one had occurred.  \\n\\nSpoiler alert.  [Health issues occurred.](_URL_0_)\\n\\n\\nSo on top of all of that, you have a layer cake of risk, with those least likely to be negatively affected by taking the risks being insulated from all of the liability associated with their wealth generation.  All in the pursuit for a \"bridge fuel\" to help with carbon emissions, which are the number 1 cause of global climate change.  \\n\\nFurther, with 50% of carbon emissions being related to energy production, switching from one hydrocarbon fuel source (coal or oil) to another (gas) is just a lateral move, even if the emissions from a combined cycle natural gas plant are far far far better than any coal plant.  Especially during a time when wind and solar were industrial methods of generating power that had roughly equivalent costs per MW produced.  \\n\\nSo to answer your question, the bad for the environment aspect comes in a few volleys:\\n1.) burning of hydrocarbons produced by drilling at the consumer level\\n2.) Escape of hydrocarbons during production and transportation.\\n3.) Displacements of renewable energy technology and investment in favor for hydrocarbon based energy.\\n4.) Improper well design and siting leading to direct contamination of aquifers (uncommon)\\n5.) Above ground chemical storage of fracking fluid being released into the environment: i.e. due to Storms, inefficient lining, poor oversight. I\\'m going to actually ELI5 here.\\n\\nFracking by itself is actually not bad as long as we do it in the right places. Frac fluid is usually a combination of water, lubricants and sand. The sand keeps the cracks we form open, the lubricants and other additives help deal with the mechanics of pumping fluid to high enough pressure to actually crack the rock. The water is there as a solvent (mix everything into it).\\n\\nFractures are unpredictable, typically they will travel along naturally weak parts of the rock. In many cases this is actually horizontally (flat for you 5 year olds) since most hydrocarbons we frack for (oil and gas) occur in sedimentary rocks like sandstone and more recently shale. These rocks are more or less deposited over time in big flat sheets, I\\'m not going to get into structures like anticlines, faults or domes except that sometimes a frack will travel along a natural fault line.\\n\\nNow lets look at how a typical oil or gas well is constructed. There are typically at least 2 (if not 3 or 4) pipes put into the ground. The first one is called the surface casing. In most civilized parts of the world this is set in competent (stable) rock well below the lowest water bearing aquifer and cemented in place. Then we sometimes have 1 or more intermediate casings that run down to where we want to produce our oil or gas from. Since most wells are horizontal now this means this string of casing runs down right into the production unit and is also cemented in place by forcing cement down the well and up the sides of the casing. When done properly this provides two layers of protection to the water table. Then you run what is called the production liner. This is another string of pipe that has holes in it ONLY WHERE WE PLAN ON PUMPING OIL OR GAS. \\n\\nSo now that we have that background let\\'s examine where it is OK to frack and where we should probably be worried. In deep deposits such as those found in the foothills of the Rockies in Canada (WCSB) fracking will NEVER contaminate the ground water UNLESS the drilling contractor did not properly set and cement those casings or the casing breaks for some reason. This is why I prefer to drill with at least one intermediate casing.\\n\\nIn shallow gas areas such as the Eastern US sometimes there is no room to set the surface casing deep enough to make it into a solid rock formation so they end up cementing casing in loose (highly permeable) rock that doesn\\'t protect anything. Other times the fractures can actually travel far enough upwards to penetrate into the aquifer which is a whole new type of problem because we can\\'t even pretend to know where the source of contamination is.\\n\\nTL:DR\\n\\nFracking by itself is not bad. Most issues arise from improper construction of the well above the fractured zone. Most of the concrete evidence that we have points to the biggest issue being disposal of waste water. Fracking uses large amounts of water, and that water needs to be disposed of properly. If it\\'s not, then it winds up flowing back into the ground water, or contaminating the area.\\n\\nThere\\'s also evidence pointing to the idea that fracking causes earthquakes in the area by disrupting the ground near the wells. More study is needed, but it\\'s definitely a scary prospect.'),\n",

       "  'The comments about pus being a byproduct of infection and inflammation are quite right, although it\\'s worth remembering that the creation of pus is specifically related to clearing infection from the body. White blood cells are attracted to the site of disease through processes like chemotaxis (migrating to sites that have high levels of chemicals either released by bacteria, or released by other white blood cells), and pus is formed as they engulf bacteria and then lyse/destroy them. All of the dead blood cells, bacteria and other breakdown products are what form pus (and by weight it\\'s almost all white blood cells).\\n\\nLike most processes relating to infection, you can have too much of a good thing, and while the inflammatory response is necessary for healing, pus building up to the visible levels the OP is thinking of is a sign that infection is not under control. If pus collects into an abscess, it\\'s best to drain it away - even if you are on antibiotics, the pH changes considerably in the middle of an abscess, and antibiotics may not penetrate to the middle or work as well.\\n\\nThe belief that pus was necessary to healing is an old one, so the question is common - \"laudable pus\" was though to be a good part of healing and so encouraged until fairly recently in medical history!\\n\\nSource: infectious diseases physician. It\\'s basically formed of dead white blood cells. When you get a wound that ends up being infected your body sends loads of white blood cells to target and eat the bacteria. Many of the white blood cells end up dying either due to old age or because the bacteria release chemicals that kill them. \\n\\nSo it doesn\\'t serve a \\'function\\' so much as it is a by-product of some types of bacterial (or fungal) infection. Like many said, it doesn\\'t aid in wound healing. It is a by-product of your body fighting an infection and can actually inhibit wound healing. \\n\\nToo much pus can cause a wound to get stuck in the Inflammation Stage of wound healing. The dead bacteria ( if gram -) release endotoxins and there are other inflammatory chemicals and whatnot floating around which don\\'t help to heal the wound. \\nTrapped pus can form an abscess~~, and sometimes a cyst~~ when your body tries to wall off the infection. \\n\\nAlso, wounds heal best in a moist environment. Too much pus and other liquids (called exudate) can lead to the breakdown of the surrounding healthy skin. \\n\\nEdit: thanks u/cclugston13 for correcting me about cysts... I know mostly about chronic wounds, not so much other health related things.\\n\\nFor those curious about moist wound healing- google up Dr. George Winter. This approach is used for many chronic wounds and is very successful. \\nHealthy individuals with small wounds generally don\\'t need this type of wound environment to heal, but it would still help it heal faster, but healthy people heal so fast that it really is more trouble than it\\'s worth. Neosporin plus band-aid is generally *too much* moisture and leads to maceration- the breakdown of healthy skin (when your skin starts turning white and wrinkly). \\n\\nSource: product development specialist for wound dressing company. It\\'s like the cleanup after the war. You don\\'t want any dead bodies lying around cuz then people would get sick. So you all put the corpses in one place and seal it off from the rest of the community. No one gets sick. And some outside force should drain the deadpool or else the dam might break and infect everyone. Pus is a mixture of bacteria, toxic proteins, dead tissue, and white blood cells. It\\'s basically what\\'s left after your body fights off an infection. In most cases the body will absorb the pus and dispose of it, but in some cases it can form an isolated abscess which the body cannot drain on its own. I would say pus is more of an outcome than a function, it is mostly made up of dead white blood cells which are the result of your body trying to fight an infection. Not a doctor or anything, but I want to add that pus surrounds whatever the offending foreign body is. This allows it to be ejected from the body... Think popping a pimple. \\n\\nI once brushed my bare foot by a wicker basket. My toe hurt to walk on for weeks afterwards, but it looked normal. One day I squeezed it for a while and eventually out came a sliver of wicker. Hadn\\'t even realized the connection until that point. My foot felt normal after that. Thank you pus. Pus is dead neutrophils (a type of white blood cell). They are one of the first to arrive at the scene of injury. They release cytokines to attract other white blood cells to the scene and thus amplify the immune response. Not only are they the first to respond, but they are also the first to die. When they die, they become pus! The yellow-greenish color comes from the copper in the neutrophils. Follow up: why is some pus gooey and gross and other pus hard? If you think of your immune system as your body\\'s military, pus is basically a battlefield after a battle -- it\\'s a giant pile of the corpses of white blood cells (your body\\'s soldiers) and the bacteria they were sent to fight. It\\'s indicative that your body\\'s military force is intervening and taking care of the problem, but if the pile of corpses gets too big, that might indicate that your side is getting overwhelmed by the bacteria. OK. I\\'m going to actually explain this to a small child. \\n\\nThe pus is there because when you get a cut there\\'s bad germs and your body sends special white blood cells to the germs to kill it and keep your body safe. Then when the special white blood cells finish their job they turn into the pus. It\\'s formed by white blood cells kamikazi-ing into bacteria and then the lumps forming together The green colour of pus comes from the enzyme myeloperoxidase, abundant in neutrophils: white blood cells that travel to inflamed tissues and attack bacteria. \\n\\nAdvia blood analysers use myeloperoxidade to count neutrophils. I pity anyone that uses one of those piles of crap and has to deal with the arrogant reps. Gold standard white cell differential, my arse! Is this the same thing for a cyst or a zit or pimple? Follow up: Then why do we have pimples with puss on our face from eating junk? I wouldnt think our body is fighting any infection there? Its a combination of whiteblood cells macrophages and bacteria. The white blood cells and macrophages are attracted to the site of infection. If its small and just bacteria they essentially consume the bacteria and are excreted through the wound or into the pore. If its caused by a larger issue such as a foreign body they surround it and consume the bacteria forming a barrier to help prevent further infection entering the tissue and blood. Puss and blood can also form a scab on the surface of wounds which helps prevent more bacteria from entering the wound. \\n\\n\\nIm a nurse. Its a basic understanding. I learnt way more in bio101 but tbh I\\'ve never needed a more in depth understanding of that particular mechanism. Pus is dead white blood cells. It indicates an infection because there are white blood cells present (an immune response). A few years ago I was swimming in the sea in Croatia when I slammed my hand into a big sea urchin, covered in hundreds of brittle spines. Hurt like hell, couldn\\'t get them out. Next day I was contemplating hospital or doctor treatment but I was on an island off another island so I left it. Anyway, it got red and infected on the third day and, due to the build up of a tiny bit of pus around each spine, I was able to squeeze them all out and it was like new the day after. Bodies are well designed. To be extremely blunt, it serves no purpose in healing wounds as anything other than a byproduct. Pus is, very simply, a bunch of goo that is made up of dead things that your body killed and some of the white blood cells that killed them. A medical practice that should be considered more often is sterile maggot abridement in active infected open wounds. Wound cleansing by maggots is precise, sterile, and works 24/7 under special bandages. Puss is the bodies of the fallen solders your body sends to fight infection.  Specifically, puss is the build up of dead white blood cells. 5 is a little early to learn about da puss, isn\\'t it?'),\n",

In addition, the US is newer, less settled, and more sparsely populated.  These means there can be more significant differences in land prices, or greater opportunities to own more land. You are now seeing a return of middle and upper clases to inner city in most major U.S. cities, but the main cause for those classes fleeing to the suburbs was called \"white flight\" where they wanted to get away from minorities and the perceived threats of crime and dropping property values. Invention of the 30 year mortgage allowed people to afford homes, and as cars became commonplace, the interstate system was developed, real estate developers built new homes in rapidly expanding suburban areas. White middle and upper middle class could afford to buy these new homes, while the poor and minorities remained in the older rental properties and smaller homes in the cities. History and development patterns, and most importantly, the highway and white flight. The cities of Europe developed before cars or even trains, and they built high end buildings in the city center, to be close to work and the centers of power.  In the 1800s, factories were then built on the outskirts of town. \\n\\nIn the US, it was still very unsettled when industrialization began, so factories were often built near the downtown area. When rails and trams were developed, the rich wanted places in the suburbs away from the pollution and crowding. Then, after WW2, the US started building highways. Instead of preserving all the older city cores, the highways were often built right through them, demolishing the old housing stock and then creating a loud, polluting highway. The US used to allow land use rules where a private development could say \"no minorities.\" Once that was declared illegal, a lot of white people decided to move out of the older city center to new suburbs serviced by the highway. And the US government encouraged this with subsidized development loans, and they excluded the inner cities from loan eligibility. \\n\\nThe US also actively dismantled much of its train infrastructure, while Europe invested in theirs. \\n\\nTL:DR: Government policies that actively encouraged suburban sprawl and hurt the cities in the US, vs cultivation of the cities in Europe. In the US, post civil war, black people left the rural south for urban centers, mostly in the north, in various surges over the following decades. This influx of uneducated blacks to cities created poor black ghettos. Poverty breeds crime, so these areas were dangerous and urban black people became synonymous with crime and danger to white people.\\n\\nWhen the highway and interstate system began being developed and access to automobiles became ubiquitous in the mid and late 1940s, wealthier white people began leaving urban areas in favor of new suburbs, a phenomenon called White Flight. You might want to google \"block busting\" too. Anyway, the result was white people left huge sections of urban centers and took their money with them. This left the cities to decay.\\n\\nNow this process is reversing, racial tensions and crime are way down, so the incentive to stay away is basically gone and traffic is up, so incentive to return to the cities is on the rise. Wealthy people deciding to buy property in the city is driving up property values in urban centers. This eventually pushes out low income residents that can\\'t afford rent increases as high income people compete for the same spaces and rental units are improved to attract higher paying renters. Some people deride the process as \"gentrification\", other people praise it as \"urban renewal\". Whatever you call it, it is just money returning to the city and this process is in various stages in different cities.\\n\\nEDIT: I should point out that during white flight, many properties fell into the hands of large scale landlords and new residents were renters in most cases. This is what is facilitating rapid gentrification, those low income residents don\\'t own the properties and are easily forced out by raising rent. The few resident home owners in these neighborhoods are seeing their home values go up 500% in the past 20 years and will often jump at the chance to sell to make a huge windfall profit. A very, very few home owners that want to stay are finding they cannot afford new, higher property taxes, but it is extremely rare that someone that has paid off their house can\\'t afford the small amount for taxes. The rich live in the suburbs in the UK too. In fact most of the poor come from the inner city in London... Such as Hackney, Haringey, Peckham, Brixton etc... Due to a lot of social housing estates. Times are changing where house prices have jumped up so much however. Im gonna be honest with you, I don\\'t think you\\'ve ever been to a major American city. \\nTry renting/buying a place in lower Manhattan, and once you get there, try buying/renting on a higher floor. Poor people live farther from the city center  IE - Harlem - Brookly- NJ\\n\\nSame with Chicago\\n\\nThe only place you might see this is when it comes to land, if a wealthy person wants to have more land they have to move to the suburbs.\\n\\nAlso, in the UK, REALLY RICH people live on the countryside on their huge estates. First off, it is not so in Greece. Here there\\'s a mixture of both, varying from neighborhood to neighborhood. There\\'s rich neighborhoods and poor neighborhoods in Athens, and rich and poor suburbs all around Attica, the bigger area where Athens is sited. In Vienna the rich are in the innermost part of the city all around are basically all kinds of people but in the outer skirts you have mostly middle class/rich again. I took a course in cultural geography back in 2013 and this sounded familiar. I honestly don\\'t remember writing this, but this is from my notes:\\n\\nThe concentric-zone model describes different social groups by their relative location in a city. It proposes that social groups form in rings (zones) surrounding an inner core, which is the central-business district. \\n\\nThe zone that surrounds the central-business district is the transition zone. The transition zone was traditionally defined as an area where the lowest-income segment of the city’s population lived. Often tenements were built in this area specifically for people who worked in the central-business district. Ethnic ghettos were often common.  Today, these same areas are sometimes in ruins or abandoned. The next zone is the blue-collar zone, where workers in the factories of the first two zones resided. This zone is more permanent in nature. It was formed by workers seeking better housing. Ethnic neighborhoods were common. The next zone is middle-income and features even nicer residences. People in this area were able to move further away from the CBD due to advances in public transportation. The outermost zone is the highest income and features more spacious residences. The people who live there are still able to access the CBD through public transportation, but they have moved outward to find a higher quality of life and to be among a homogenous group of people. This area was considered suburbs.\\n\\nThe concentric-zone model was used to describe a new state of cities in the 1920s. According to the text, people of various incomes were more randomly interspersed prior to changes in the late 1800s, such as streetcars, real estate speculation in the suburbs, and inner-city industrial development. Europe\\'s countries are older than USA, so the most central parts of European cities are the oldest and most attractive, with highest value and attraction.\\n \\nFor example, the city centre of my town was built by Romans, in 4th century, and over the course if history, Venice, Ottomans and French left their imprint on the architecture. \\n\\nSuburbs are \\'newer\\' areas, usually built haphazardly, to accommodate expansion of the city. For example, they are mass-built to accommodate industrial revolution and the influx of workers and their families. \\n\\nHowever, many rich people have so-called country/summer/weekend houses which are bigger than those in the city (as you mostly can\\'t build or do expansion on flats and houses in the old and historical parts of the town). Interesting to know is, that this changes once in a while in Europe. There are times where rich lives in suburbs and poor in cities, then it changes to the other way round. What we have now is,  that the rich have a flat in the inner city and a house in the suburbs which leads into increasing prices, too. I\\'m not sure it\\'s always true. While it might apply for Paris for instance, I can assure you the wealthier neighbors of Brussels are in the suburbs, but certainly not in the inner city.\\n\\n\\nIt\\'s really a matter of history. Like many people pointed out such as /u/AgoraiosBum, European cities are usually way older than U.S., before the industrialization era. This difference changes how the city was built and evolved with time. \\n\\nStill, sometimes national and local policies will directly influence how a city population spread out. In France for instance, after WWII, they built the \"social cities\" for the immigrants in the suburbs, so poor people were, and are still, living there. In Brussels, the city is smaller, rent more affordable and the public transports are decent, so the richer classes \"flew\" in the suburbs where they could have bigger houses while still staying close to urban commodities. This is one of the worst threads I\\'ve read in a while. City centers are far too expensive for the poor. The exception is section 8, public housing, or homelessness. Without rent assistance I can hardly imagine there are any poor people in any major city center. FYI I\\'ve lived in SF, LA, Paris, San Diego. Suburbs are a wash, half wealthy, half poor. Mostly due to gentrification of areas like west/north Oakland. The generalization isn\\'t accurate. Many European cities suffered middle class flight and are filled with poorer immigrants, surrounded by wealthier suburbs. While many US cities have expensive cores surrounded by poorer hoods.\\n\\nIt depends a lot on the history of each city. If you look at London for example, you still have sections of the inner city where poor people live. But because property prices are so high and property developers are under-regulated and regulations on affordable housing often not enforced, poor people are being priced out.\\n\\nAs other commenters have explained how you have wealthier people fleeing to suburbs I\\'ll skip that. But what we\\'re seeing in London for example, is the city is getting so big and expensive to live in, the city centre is becoming gentrified. Poor people are forced out by prices and government policy.\\n\\nSome people are so rich, they can afford a nice spacious house and garden in the suburbs or posh commuter towns further out from London, and because the city is such a major hub, transport links make it easy to live like 25 miles from central London and still drive and/or get the train to work in city centre. And even afford the now sky-high property prices in central London, some people have a house in the city and in the countryside.\\n\\nIn London, while the city is huge and prices are high because property-prices and rents for shops are high, parts of the city centre are still spacious and have parks, wide streets and lovely Georgian houses. For those who have very high-paying jobs in the city (and a wealthy family to start with!), the city centre could be seen as a desirable place to live since those parts don\\'t have pesky poor people and (non-white-collar) crime to worry about. And when they\\'re bored with the city they can always drive out to their home in the countryside! The simplest answer is age. European cities developed a long time ago, and there were rich and poor alike crowded into a very small area. Thanks to a rapidly growing population, the enclosure movement, and the industrial revolution, cities became significantly more important and grew almost exponentially. The rich people didn\\'t want all the poor people living where they lived and worked (London was a great example of this), and so they literally destroyed the slums. Thus, a ring formed around the city full of the displaced people who could still get to their jobs due to the newly developing train systems.\\n\\nThe US, on the other hand, had no such crowding issues while they were building most of their cities. American cities are significantly earlier in their lifespan, and the economy during their development was still largely agrarian. Though there was a lot of industry, it wasn\\'t necessarily as concentrated as industrial centres in Europe were. More and more minorities wound up in cities over time, particularly after the civil war, and thanks to discrimination they were shunted into particular areas of cities and denied opportunities to partake of the booming economy throughout the later nineteenth and earlier twentieth century. This, then, established the poor inner city areas in the same time that Europe was excising theirs. In London the inner city is a mix of wealth and extreme poverty. For example, Tower Hamlets is a stone\\'s throw from one of the world\\'s leading financial centres, but is home to some of the most deprived people in the UK.\\n\\nThis is kind of changing, as London\\'s property boom continues, poor people are increasingly being priced out of the city. Have you ever been to Europe? I live in the UK and the poor always live in the inner city areas. The city centre and suburbs are were the more well off people live (the same as in pretty much every city in world). I\\'m not sure if that\\'s really true, I live in the UK and the city I\\'m close to goes rich,poor,middle,rich from the inside out in general Before the proliferation of the automobile, rich Americans did live in cities.  Famously, the University of Southern California elected to keep a plot of land it had in south central LA (near downtown) where the rich folk lived, and sold a plot of land up the coast in Malibu, which was difficult to get to and sparsely populated.  Once White Flight hit America, rich people flocked to Malibu and south central LA became a bastion for gang violence and poverty.  Today, USC remains in dangerous south central LA, while the plot of land sold in Malibu turned into arguably the most beautiful campus in the country: Pepperdine. In the UK at least the inner city is still dominated by those less fortunate. During the industrial revolution the inner-city city was more of a slum for the factory workers. These poor quality houses have only started to be improved within the last 30(?)years or so. Gentrification has helped with inviting the wealthy upper classes into the inner-city and out of the suburbs by turning old tenement buildings into luxury apartments this does unfortunately drive the original poorer community out due to not being able to afford the new much higher rent. That\\'s not true, In EU there\\'s also a trend of middle/high living in suburbs. And poor living in inner city. There reason for this is because in many cities, welfare housing/flats the city owns are located in inner city, the middle/high class  then moves away from them due to high criminality/vandalism/anti-social experience. American metropolitan areas don\\'t consist only of the \"inner city\" and \"suburbs\".  Cities consist of many neighborhoods.  They vary widely in wealth.  \\n\\nLook at NYC.  There is vast poverty in a borough like Harlem, but a borough like Manhattan is one of the wealthiest places on Earth. What?

By observing the sun and visible planets, his theory more elegantly described what was observed than the previous Earth-centric explanation, but he didn\\'t actually know for certain that it was true. But scientists to follow continued to investigate it, improving the model to reflect observations and gathering evidence to support it.\\n\\nFrom [the wiki](_URL_0_):\\n >  During the 17th century, several further discoveries eventually led to the wider acceptance of heliocentrism:\\n\\n > * Using the newly invented telescope, Galileo discovered the four large moons of Jupiter (evidence that the solar system contained bodies that did not orbit Earth), the phases of Venus (the first observational evidence not properly explained by the Ptolemaic theory) and the rotation of the Sun about a fixed axis[43] as indicated by the apparent annual variation in the motion of sunspots;\\n\\n > * With a telescope, Giovanni Zupi saw the phases of Mercury in 1639;\\n\\n > * Kepler in 1609 introduced the idea that the orbits of the planets were elliptical rather than circular, while retaining the heliocentric concept.\\n\\n > * Isaac Newton in 1687 proposed universal gravity and the inverse-square law of gravitational attraction to explain Kepler\\'s elliptical planetary orbits.\\n\\nEach step helped build credibility until it became the favored theory. It\\'s been about 10 years since I studied this, so there might be some points that need fine tuning:\\n\\nOk.  According to Ptolomey, the Earth sits in the center of the universe.  Orbiting around the earth are the moon and sun, and beyond those are the planets.  At the edge of the spherical universe, there is basically a wall.  On that wall are the stars that we know.\\n\\nThe main reason that the ancient greeks knew the planets were not \"stars\" as they thought of stars, or basically, from what I understand, bright spots on the wall at the edge of the universe is that the planets move at different rates across the night sky than do the stars.  Stars slowly move over the course of the year across the night sky.  Over the course of one year, the stars appear to make a complete rotation across the night sky.  This was actually how the original astronomers knew that the earth was spherical.  If the earth was not spherical and was flat, that the stars are in a different location each night would mean they were traveling in one direction.  However, after exactly 1 year, the night sky repeats itself with the exception of certain locations of planets.  With only astronomical tables detailing the movement of stars in the night sky and the idea that everything in the universe would be \"perfect\" shapes (spheres), the easy deduction based only on the movement of the stars and the earth is that the earth is a sphere in the center of the universe, and stars on the edge of the universe rotate around the earth.  \"Gravity\" was called \"downward tendency\" until it was actually discovered to be gravity.  Downward tendency was the tendency for all objects that had weight to travel toward the center of the unvierse.  Planets, the greeks thought, did not have weight.  It was thought that the sun, moon, and planets were floating bodies.\\n\\nThe big issue with this model of the solar system is that while the stars appear to rotate around the earth in an exact sphere, the planets move in strange patterns.  One night a planet will appear to be moving in one direct.  The next night it will stop.  The next night it will appear to move in the opposite direction.  The night after that it will start moving forward again.\\n\\nSince the greeks believed that gods designed the universe according to perfect forms, they believed that everything would be perfect spheres and circles.  This movement of the planets was at odds with a conception that the planets would rotate in a perfect ceircle.  What the greeks theorized was that planets actually moved on two circles.  They were called epicenters or something.  The planet moved in a circle around one circle.  And that circle was actually rotating around another circle that was around the earth.\\n\\nFor a long time, this was understood to be the model of the solar system.  The reason for the bizarre behavior of the planets was that they actually had what were effectively two orbits.\\n\\nCopernicus discovered that these \"epicenters\" or double circles could largely be removed from a working diagram of the universe if the rotations of the planets were actually rotations around the sun.  Still, copernicus theorized some planets had multiple orbits.  This worked in simplyfing the existing model of the solar system.  However, Kepler theorized that the orbits were actually eliptical rather than perfect circles.  This removed the need for some planets to have multiple orbits or tracks on two circles. The idea of \"circles\" is basically rooted in an idea that god would make the universe according to certain perfect shapes.  It\\'s important to note that Copernicus was a polish monk.  Although his ideas challenged church doctrine, he was a monk.  He had access to his astronomy charts only because of the church.  These ideas about religion shaped his understanding.\\n\\nFor the most part, this is the model of the solar system of the day.  My real knowledge of this is based on ptolomey copernicus and kepler.  I have not spent much time working with the Principia by Newton, and so I don\\'t want to further delve into how newton changed this idea.'),\n",

As Mason11987 has mentioned, your question is really broad. However, I think I can illuminate some things for you to help you better your understanding of international politics and the current state of affairs.\\n\\nFirst, you have to understand the current nature of the international system. During the Cold War, the world was basically **bipolar**: two super powers - the USA and the USSR - were the dominant forces that shaped world politics. Both of these super powers exercised leadership among a group of either like-minded or subdued followers - Western Europe for the US, Eastern Europe for the USSR. These blocs were not exactly friendly towards each other. Due to something called [mutual assured destruction](_URL_0_), however, they never openly fought against each other, as the results would have been horrific.\\n\\nAfter the collapse of the USSR, the international system shifted from **bipolarity** to **unipolarity**, i. e. only one super power was left - the USA. This relatively brief moment of total US-American preponderance is currently nearing its end again. Rising new powers like China, Brazil, Russia and India - commonly known as the BRICs - but also potentially the European Union are gaining more influence in the international arena. It is likely that these countries (or regions) will continue accumulating more clout and capabilities, and that therefore the preponderance of the USA will eventually come to an end. That is not to say that another country is going to replace the USA in its former hegemonic position, but rather that the **relative advantage** of the US is going to decline. \\n\\nNow there are very many different opinions on how this might affect international politics and whether or not the change from unipolarity to multipolarity is a good or a bad thing. [Hegemonic stability theory](_URL_3_) for example assumes that a potent and mostly unchallenged hegemon is a provider of stability and international order. Other theorists claim that a second super power to keep the first in check is to the advantage of all. \\n\\nThe US foreign policy establishment is very well aware of the changing world around them, but there are many different approaches on how the US should deal with this fact. [Realists](_URL_1_) might be very concerned about the rise of China and advocate policies that amount to containment, whereas for example [liberals](_URL_2_) might suggest a foreign policy that seeks to integrate China into the existing international order in hopes that more economic interdependence, more international trade and an increased involvement of China in international institutions might help to ensure that China\\'s rise remains peaceful. \\n\\nPresident Obama\\'s policies have so far incorporated aspects and ideas from both approaches, e. g. through reinforcing the security guarantees to countries such as Japan and South Korea, who feel threatened by China\\'s rise and new assertiveness, but also through improving ties and economic relations with China itself. It is yet to be seen whether this strategy will, in the long run, turn out to create the desired results.\\n\\nThis got a little bit theoretic in the end and is definitely not ELI5, but maybe you still enjoy reading it.

As the water begins to drain, the flow of water comes from the edges towards the center. This creates momentum at an angle from the direction the water is actually being allowed to move - straight down. The further (and thus faster) the water travels on the way towards the drain point, the more angular momentum it has.\\n\\nYou can envision this as a golf ball just barely hitting the hole - it skirts around the edge of the cup before dropping in (Or if you're really unlucky, skirts the edge and changes direction before not going in). More or less the same is happening to the water. It has speed in a direction that isn't straight down the drain.\\n\\nThis is what forms the vortex. A common misconception is that the direction (and the cause of the vortex) is the Coriolis effect, which is caused by the earth's rotation. This is actually not true. Although you can create conditions where you can observe the coriolis force creating vortexes that always go in the same direction (Depending on your hemisphere), most times the direction of the vortex is random, if the shape of the vessel or the drain doesn't affect the direction the vortex would form. You know how a dancer or skater spins fast when they pull their arms close to their bodies? Or how you can spin faster or slower on a rotating chair by adjusting your arms and legs? Well, it is the same story with a draining container.\\n\\nThere will be some rotation in the body of water. As the water moves towards the drain, that rotation will be concentrated, creating a vortex. Drill a hole in a table.  Attach a ball to a string, and thread the string through the hole.   Roll the ball in a random direction on the table, and start pulling the string.  The closer you pull the ball toward the hole, the faster it will spin around the hole.  Depending on the starting random direction, the spin will either be clockwise or counter clockwise.  If you did this with a large number of balls, each with a different starting direction, the balls spinning in opposite directions would bounce into each each and cancel their spin.  If the clockwise spinning balls exactly balanced the counterclockwise spinning balls, then all the spinning would stop.  But this is unlikely.  In most cases, there would be slightly more of one kind of spin, and that would dominate as the balls reached the center to form a vortex.\\n\\nThis is the same process that causes the planets to spin around the sun, and the Saturn’s rings to spin.  Only in space, there is no friction, so they keep spinning and don’t spiral to the center.  The solar system and Saturn’s rings stay mostly in one plane because the collisions cancel all motion out of the plane, but not the spinning motion once everything is spinning in the same direction.\"),\n",

This is usually done by building a tunnel upstream and letting the water flow through it instead of the construction site.\\n\\nNext, they form the dam and let the concrete set for a couple of weeks. After the concrete is sufficiently strong, the tunnel is plugged up and the water is directed back to the dam. First, a series of tunnels were dug from below where the new dam would be, going upstream through the rock - four tunnels, each 50 feet in diameter.  The entrances were cleared LAST, of course, so they wouldn't flood, and were protected by cofferdams, which are temporary dams around a riverbank that are basically just walls stuck into the bottom of the river.  When the tunnels were ready, the cofferdams were literally blown up.\\n\\nOnce the tunnels were built and the water diverted, NEW cofferdams were built across the river at the tunnels to protect the Hoover Dam construction site and keep it dry.  Then build the dam, close the diversion tunnels, and let the river fill up the space behind the dam.  The cofferdams protecting the Hoover Dam construction site didn't actually have to be taken out, because, remember, Lake Mead is deep but the river was not.

The first to die and last to die were father and son,  J. G. Tierney and Patrick Tierney.\\n\\nIf you visit Hoover Dam, take a tour, you get to go inside the dam and walk along one of the inspection tunnels. They started off building two tunnels going around the site of the dam. These tunnels were built above the waterline. They then dumped truckloads of rock and dirt into the river blocking it and creating a small temporary dam. The water level behind this dam rose until it came up to the tunnels which were built and diverted the water away from the construction site. This allowed the construction workers to work on the dam on the dry river floor. The dam includes valves which allows the river to flow under the dam if needed. The diversion tunnels also have valves which allows them to be sealed. When the dam construction were done the valves were closed off and the water level were allowed to rise to the top of the dam. First you create a diversion channel that goes around the site of the dam. Depending on the location of the dam, this can be a tunnel through rock, or just digging a temporary riverbed around the site. Next, you install a cofferdam upstream and downstream of the location of the dam. This forces the water into the diversion channel(s) and leaves a dry area for the dam to be built. Once the dam is finished, you collapse the cofferdams and the diversion channels and the river flow returns to normal, just with the dam restricting flow causing a reservoir to build up behind it.\"),\n",

John Rhys Davies (Gimili) is Welsh.

A tangential thought, but I think it suggests an answer to your question.\\n\\nWhen the nice academics at Oxford and Cambridge first translated ancient Greek plays into English, they gave the Spartans a Scottish accent.  My professor informed our class that it was for dramatic intent, to denote a distinct cultural difference.  He also noted that branding the [brutish, less sophisticated] Spartans with that accent was a subtle dig to the Scots. The ones in the Witcher are the only cunts that sound fucking Scottish though.

As the protests grew larger, the military basically told Morsi to GTFO. He refused, and so the government rode in and removed him from power and threw him in jail. The military has been running the country since then.\\n\\nObviously a lot of people (especially Morsi supporters) are not happy with the military overthrowing an elected government. So there's been a lot more protesting, much of which the military government has responded to rather forcefully. \\n\\nLeaving aside the issue of whether or not Morsi's group (The Muslim Brotherhood) was really qualified to run the country, they've now been forcefully removed from positions in government that they were democratically elected to.

       " ('How do amplifiers work?',\n",
       "  'This explanation depends somewhat on knowing basic electronics concepts. \\n\\nA transistor is a unit with 3 connections only. One is a pathway for current out of the transistor, usually ground. One is for controlling current. The last one is connected to a higher voltage, which is the source for current.\\n\\nIf you expose the control to a changing signal, you\\'ll get a changing amount of current flowing through the transistor. Technically, a certain type of amplification is already occurring.\\n\\nBut we usually start with voltage and want to end with voltage. One way to achieve this is for the transistor to draw its current through a resistor, which will produce a changing voltage thanks to the fundamental relationship between current and voltage passing through a resistor.\\n\\nThe problem is, this is a changing amount of current flowing in one direction. We usually want current flowing in both directions, alternately, for a signal like music playing through headphones.\\n\\nIn short, you use an assortment of transistors passing electricity in one direction only *within each one*, but in opposite directions to other ones in the circuit. It takes some complex and clever design, but you get it balanced right and you can create current flow in both directions, just like your original source.\\n\\nA helpful tool is that you can make \"backwards\" transistors that control flow with a controlling signal that is compared to the high voltage, not low.\\n\\nGoing into much more detail gets into \"take a class\" or \"read an intro to EE\" textbook levels of explanation, but that\\'s the basic idea. Transistors take small signals and make them big. Hook them together right and you can get them to take the signal you need to use and produce a bigger one of the right type. In general terms, an amplifier is a system where a small change in the input causes a big change in the resulted output. For an analogy, think about the flow of the river through a dam. When the dam is closed no water can pass through, but if we raise the damn just a few centimeters, a large amount of water from the river behind him will start to rush in.\\n\\nThe electronic vacuum tube or the solid-state transistors in your amplifier are working in a similar fashion. Without getting into the physics behind their operation, you can think of an amplifier as a set of vacuum tubes or a set of transistors, acting as dams and directing the flow of electricity from the main power supply to your headphones or speakers.\\n\\n A small change of current at the base of the transistor will result in a big change of the current that pass through him  from the supply to the output.'),\n",

One moment you see the world wrong then suddenly it is right. If you do it repeatedly you get faster till you can put the lenses on and blink once. In the 1950\\'s, Theodor Erismann did experiments that took him about 8 days to fully adapt to upside down vision.  \\n\\nMore recent experiments showthatyour brain starts to change immediately and make adjustments.  \\n\\nExperiments where someone\\'s vision is completely obscured show that after 3 days, the areas of the brain responsible for vision are already being used for non-visual tasks.  \\n\\nThere are a lot of experiments on this but I would suggest a search on prism goggles.  They also have ones that shift your visualfield to the right or left.  I saw a pair once that used mirrors so you could only see behind you.\\n\\nIf you start at 11:30 in this video it talks about some experiments being done, but the whole show is good.  _URL_0_ I\\'ve never heard of wearing upside-down goggles before? Is this something new? ELI5 please. I got my first pair of varifocals recently and they have a similar thing, so it may shed some light.\\n\\nFor two full days I was constantly moving my head around to get the thing I was looking at in focus through the right part of the lens. The optician even said \"you\\'ll be a nodding donkey for a while\" and she was right. Because the lens power varies continuously across the lens in both directions there are *no* straight lines and only a small area that actually works for what your looking at.\\n\\nFor the first day I even had to take them off occasionally while nascent motion sickness went away.\\n\\nWhen I woke up on the third morning and put them on I thought I\\'d picked up the wrong glasses, everything was just in focus wherever I looked.\\n\\nThey were the right varifocal glasses though. Even more interestingly (to me at least) if I try to *make* the image go out of focus or warped I can\\'t do it.\\n\\nI only ever see the warping effect (that I couldn\\'t get rid of for the first two days) out of the corner of my eye maybe once every couple of days, and it\\'s one of those things that goes away instantly if you try to look at it harder. A similar thing happened to typesetters who had to hand-place lettering into printing machines.  They learned to read everything upside down AND backwards.  Many could proofread a newspaper as it was set. Try playing video games on \"inverted\" meaning when you press down on the stick, you look up. \\n\\nYou still press down to look up, but you get used to it after a while. What I\\'m curious about is what would happen if you wore high quality VR googles that fed your eyes a 360 degree panorama taken from video cameras around your head (maybe with a high-resolution magnified area at the front)\\n\\nWould your brain eventually stitch the left and the right together so that you experienced a full 360 degree field of view, or would it always feel like your field of vision had left and right boundaries? Dennis from Smarter Every Day did something similar I think with riding a bicycle that turned opposite to the handlebar movement. I think it would be a VERY gradual change, where you slowly get better at doing things without flipping the image back to what you\\'re used to in your mind. Nothing would LOOK different, but your capabilities would increase over time. My friend and I wore vision flipping goggles for a few weeks one childhood summer. It was difficult for some days, but on the third or fourth day, I woke up and went my whole day before remembering I had it on. I don\\'t remember if everything was still upside down, but I do remember there were no issues for the remaining week or so.\\n\\nThere was a day adjustment period after taking them off (when my parents made me for some outing), but a goodnight sleep reverted me back. \\n\\nI wonder if both adjustment periods would be longer as an adult, or if there are some remains of memories from that time that would switch back on. Visual stimuli already hit our retina upside down. Our visual perception is actually based on stimulus information from our inner ear (fluid that due to gravity helps us determine our bodies position relative to the ground) and visual stimuli. Thus, after a 10ish days of wearing these glasses, our perception simply flips. There is no transition period. More interesting, when you take the glasses off, the world again appears to be upside down for a few minutes.\\n\\nEdit: For another example of how our perception is based on a summation of our senses, please watch this video on the McGurk effect. This one shows how visual information changes our perception of sound.\\n\\n_URL_1_\\n\\nEdited for correct time it takes for the effect to occur. \"what color is the dress?\" ...

Context: Humans actually see upside down, but our brains hide this from us.  Because the front part of the eye is curved, it bends the light, creating an upside down image on the retina.  The process of refraction through a convex lens causes the image to be flipped, so when the image hits your retina, it\\'s completely inverted.

The other people have answered why we can't reach the speed of light.  \\nI can explain what limits our current rockets from going faster.  \\nTo accelerate in a direction in space you need to throw stuff (also called reaction mass) in the opposite direction. Newton tells us that this will result in an opposite reaction accelerating us forward.  \\nNow the problem is that space craft only have a very limited amount of stuff to throw out, and once they are out they can't accelerate anymore.  \\nYou can be more efficient (i.e. more accelaration per kg of reaction mass) by throwing it out faster, but you will still run out. In theory we could reach near the speed of light. The problem is that we have no idea how to engineer such a spaceship.\\n\\nThe problem is mass.

They\\'ve been treated as second-class citizens and have experienced abuses from structures of power, including indiscriminate killing of those following the Jewish faith, most famously under the regime of Adolf Hitler, whose extermination of Jews is commonly referred to as the Holocaust. A big factor in this situation is the lack of a central homeland of the Jewish people. They tried, rather unsuccessfully, to integrate themselves into whatever culture they found themselves in until they were rooted out or hunted down. \\n\\nThis unstable situation gave rise to Zionism, the movement for Jews to establish their own state (country, nation, whatever word you prefer), preferably in Israel, the biblical promised land, also called Palestine.\\n\\nThe Zionist movement was kickstarted and championed by a man named Theodor Herzl. He petitioned different world powers for a grant of land for the Zionists to form a state and begin attracting Jews from around the world to make up the population. This was tricky, as the world powers were only willing to give up fairly crappy bits of land (Britain was ready to give the Zionists Uganda), and the Zionists at large were dead set on forming their state in Palestine.\\n\\nA breakthrough came with the Balfour Declaration, a position on behalf of the Crown pledging its support for the Zionists\\' place in Palestine. The declaration was later adopted by the League of Nations. \\n\\nJews began purchasing land in Palestine and working it to sustain themselves and form communities. This pissed off the local Arabs, sparking tensions that are still very present today. Over time, more and more Jews went to Israel. There were challenges along the way, such as immigration restrictions imposed by the British, unrest from the native populations, invasion attempts, the usual birth pangs of any young nation, et cetera. Here\\'s a summary:\\n- It\\'s the 19th century. Jews are being victimised in pretty much every country on the planet. A new political movement forms: Zionism, which is aimed at getting Jews their own nation-state where they can have a homeland and govern themselves. Naturally their preferred site for this nation-state is in the Palestine region of the Middle East, because Jerusalem is the most holy site in Judaism and also because the ancient Jewish kingdoms of Israel and Judea were located there.  \\n- The first wave of Jewish mass-immigration to Palestine (which at the time was part of the Ottoman Empire) takes place around the 1880s, I think. Several more waves follow over the next few decades.  \\n- World War One happens, and the Entente intends to divide up the Ottoman Empire\\'s territory amongst themselves. In 1917 Britain issues the Balfour Declaration, saying it will support establishment of a Jewish nation in Palestine at some point in the future. After WW1, Palestine falls under British control as the British Mandate of Palestine (which includes present-day Israel, Palestinian territories, and Jordan).  \\n- By the 1920s, more Jewish people are immigrating to the Mandate of Palestine from across the world. But there\\'s a problem: at the time, the Arab population of Palestine consisted mainly of tenant farmers who didn\\'t actually own the land they lived and worked on — so when the Jewish immigrants arrived and bought said land, the Arabs were forced to leave their homes. They ended up congregating in cities, and started saying \"Why should the Jews be the ones who get their own nation here? Where do they get off, stealing our homes and trying to supplant us? We\\'re the ones who live here, it should be our nation!\" That\\'s pretty much how Palestinian nationalism began.  \\n- So for the next 20-odd years there\\'s plenty of fighting in the Mandate: Jews versus Arabs and Arabs versus Jews, both of whom are trying to found their own nation on the same patch of land, and both versus the British occupying forces. Yet more Jewish refugees arrive in the aftermath of World War 2. Around 1947, Britain is like \"Fuck this, we\\'re done mediating, let\\'s let the United Nations handle it.\"  \\n- In 1947 the UN proposes a deal that will divide the Israel-West-Bank-and-Gaza region into two nations: one Jewish, one Arab. The Arabs reject it as it looks like a pretty shitty deal, giving large swathes of Arab-majority land to the Jewish nation. (Although in retrospect, they probably should\\'ve taken it.) Fighting continues.  \\n- In 1948, the British withdraw. Israel declares independence, and takes control of the whole region. It\\'s immediately attacked by all the surrounding Arab nations (which incidentally have no interest in Palestinian nationalism, and only want to grab the land for themselves); amazingly they actually manage to fight them off (although Jordan grabs the West Bank and Egypt grabs the Gaza Strip).\\n\\nSo that\\'s how Israel came to be.

You start with 1 million bacteria, then an hour later you have 2 million, then an hour later it\\'s 4 million, then 8 million, then 16 million, and so on.  You write out a formula for how much bacteria there is after N hours, and you get 1,000,000 \\\\* 2^N (note that 2^0 is 1, so this formula is just fine).\\n\\nWhen you look at this population you might ask \"how fast is the population growing?\"  Well, over the first hour it grew by 1 million bacteria so you might say that it\\'s growing at 1 million bacteria per hour, but if you counted every 30 minutes you\\'d find that there\\'s only about 1.4 million after 30 minutes but after a full hour there\\'s 2 million, so maybe you say that the population is growing at about (400,000 bacteria) / (30 minutes) = 800,000 bacteria per hour for the first half hour, then 1,200,000 bacteria per hour for the second half hour.\\n\\nYou could keep on looking at the growth over a shorter and shorter period of time and you\\'d get a more and more accurate measurement of the bacterial growth per hour.\\n\\nWhat you\\'d notice is that the number of bacteria added to the population per hour is always a constant multiple of the population:  when the population is 1 million the growth rate is 693,147/hr.  When the population is 10 million it\\'s 6,931,472/hr, and so on.  There\\'s always that constant ratio of .693147.... between the growth rate and the number of bacteria there are.\\n\\nNext we look at another population of bacteria that split a little faster.  They *triple* their population each hour, so you start with 1 million bacteria, then an hour later you have 3 million, then 9 million, and so on.  You come up with a formula for this population and it\\'s 1,000,000 \\\\* 3^(N).\\n\\nAgain you look at how fast the population is growing and again you find that there\\'s this constant ratio between the number of bacteria you add per hour (as measured over a very very short period of time) and the number of bacteria there are.  This time, though, the ratio is different:  it\\'s 1.0986... \\n\\nAt this point you ask \"How fast does the bacteria have to grow to make that ratio be 1?\"  We\\'ve seen that doubling in an hour is too low, while tripling in an hour is a bit too high.  We could guess a few more numbers and home in on the answer:  2.71828...., or *e*.  If we had a population of bacteria that had an equation of 1,000,000 \\\\* e^N then at any instant you\\'re adding more bacteria at a rate exactly equal to the population (i.e. when you have 1,200,000 bacteria you\\'re adding them at 1,200,000/hr).\\n\\nThis idea is the fundamental definition of what *e* is.  In calculus we call this idea of \"rate of change, as measured over an incredibly short period of time\" a derivative, and the derivative of e^x is e^(x).  The constant e is the only number for which that can be true; for any other number you wind up with those constants.\\n\\nYou asked about logarithms, but logarithms are just backwards exponentiation.  They confuse people because they\\'re written as a word, but they should be no more confusing than learning that subtraction undoes addition or that division undoes multiplication.  If you see that 1 + 2 = 3 then you should be able to work out that 3 - 2 = 1.  Similarly, if you see that 3 \\\\* 4 = 12 then you should be able to work out that 12 / 4 = 3.  With logarithms it\\'s the same but written more confusingly:  if 3^4 = 81 then log*_3_*(81) = 4.\\n\\nWhen you deal with exponential growth you often deal a lot with e as the base, since it has that property I mentioned earlier of having a rate of change equal to itself.  You also frequently have to deal with undoing the exponentiation if you want to find the exponent and just know the base and the answer, hence bringing in logarithms.  These two things coincide often enough that it\\'s efficient to just have shorthand for \"do the reverse of e^(a) = b\" so we write ln(b) = a.'),\n",

Stacks are a type of data structure where the data items are organized in Last In First Out (LIFO) structure. Sort of like a stack of pancakes, the newest one goes on top and is also the first one to be eaten.\\n\\nWhen you undo, the last change you made is read and removed from the top of the stack, and then used to revert your changes.\\n\\nYou can read more about stacks here:\\n_URL_0_\\n\\nSource: computer science student Real eli5 at the end of the post. \\n\\nEvery answer so far forgot to mention a pretty important fact:\\n\\nEvery program is responsible for handling the key combination itself.\\n\\nSure some very basic stuff like text boxes have their copy, paste, cut, undo, redo,... functionality provided by windows, but that\\'s it.\\n\\nPrograms that are more complex (paint, Photoshop, even Microsoft Word is a lot more complex than just a simple text box) have to implement the undo thing themselves.\\n\\n\\n\\nThere are a few different ways to do it, and most programs can get away using a sort of \"cheat\". They simply store a full snapshot of the state of what you are editing (text, images, video, audio, scripts,... Whatever) up to a certain limit. Many programs have a setting in their options window for that (called something like undo buffer size).\\n\\nSome programs don\\'t save full snapshots but instead they save the changes (deltas) which takes a LOT less space. \\n\\nAnd yet others (where applicable) even save what it is you actually did. For example in paint it would save \"start stroke at 234,921 and go to coordinate 764,613, then release the brush\". \\nAnd on undo it would just \"regenerate\" all the previous actions again onto a blank canvas, omitting the last action. \\n\\nAll approaches have their advantages and disadvantages and it depends on the specific program what strategy a program actually uses to implement its undo and redo functionality (if it even has one) \\n\\n\\nEli5:\\nProgram saves whatever you are doing everytime you do something into a big list. When you undo it just goes back one step in the lost and loads the data there. Everybody answers about \"Undo\" in Word but the first thing I thought was the suspend feature of bash (in Linux).\\n\\nOP, you should provide context. When you hold down the control modifier key and hit Z, your keyboard hardware sends 26 to the keyboard interface circuit.\\n\\nYour operating system has a driver for that keyboard interface circuit, that decides which keyboard user has \"focus\" and sends keystrokes to them.  If Ctrl-Z does something special in a program, it\\'s because that program\\'s keyboard handler has \"if (data = 26)\" in it someplace.\\n\\nWhen Ctrl-Z does something different at the system level, there is an \"if (data = 26)\" someplace in the driver, before the keystroks is passed to a program. On the lowest level it sends a control signal followed by \"z\" signal.  \\n  \\nMost operating systems implement standard functionality that captures it and reverts last changes made to the current system state. Some applications capture it themselves and undo the last Operations from a list of changes that the application kept track of, since they save all recent changes in computer memory - before saving it to your harddrive. That is why you have limited number of revert/forward (ctrl+y) actions that you can do, depending on the application you are using :) Ctrl+Z is commonly implemented through a \"command pattern\".\\n\\nWhen you bold text, move a box, or whatever in your program, a \"command\" is created.  The command is an object that contains the data of the change (e.g. box id, \\'new location\\') and two actions:\\n- do\\n- undo\\n\\nIf you tell the command to \"do\" it\\'s action then it performs the action.  The \"undo\" action performs the logically opposite function.\\n\\nEach action\\'s do  &  undo code is specific to the command.  For example, a \"move box\" command has the logic to move the box.  The \"bold\" command has logic to bold text.  From a command perspective we don\\'t really care how it is done, just that you can \"do\" and \"undo\" an action.\\n\\nThese commands are held in a \"command buffer\".  When you press Ctrl+Z the undo action of the last command is called.  The prior command becomes the last command and it can be undone.  This can be repeated until there are no more commands to undo.\\n\\nYou can also \"redo\" a command (Ctrl+Y) which calls \"do\" on the last undone command.  Like the undo chain, there is a redo chain to the next command that was undone. [The command buffer is a \"doubly linked list\"].'),\n",

       "  \"Don't assume Shkreli has done anything with KaloBios. Shkreli bought 70% of the outstanding shares of KBIO and is not allowing his shares to be lent out to cover short selling. It's that simple. We don't know what's going to happen with KBIO because we've only had this issue arise for 15 days, which is not enough time to really see what the results of Shkreli's acquisition will be. \\n\\nThe detailed answer, however, is as follows. \\n\\nAt the beginning of November, KBIO was ready to close up shop and go under. Their funding dried up, they had no money and were ready to basically declare bankruptcy. Investors saw this as an opportunity to short the stock for a small profit. Basically, they bet the stock was going to drop from, say $5 a share, to $0 a share. Investors borrowed shares from people who owned them, and then sold the borrowed shares in an attempt to make money. In order to take a profit (or loss), these traders will then buy the shares back to close the trade. \\n\\nShkreli sees this company is in dire straits and thought there was value in the company, so once the company dropped to roughly $1/Share, over the course of two days Shkreli bought ~70% of the company's outstanding shares. That is roughly 2.87 Million Shares bought against the KBIO's roughly 4.1 Million Shares outstanding. \\n\\nThe sudden surge in buying led to the stock price increasing dramatically, to the point where the company is worth now ~35+/Share. These short sellers are either scrambling to cover their shorts (basically, they took a huge loss and want out), or are opening new shorts (basically betting that the stock will drop in price at look to make even more money at this top). \\n\\nThe thing is Shkreli didn't do anything wrong. He saw an opportunity to make some money and acquire a drug company. If the story is true, he bought everything within 2 days, well within the initial Schedule 13D notice period for filing, so it's not like he broke a law concerning his ownership stake. Shkreli informed KBIO that he owned 70% of the company and began to discuss how to proceed in keeping the company up and running. \\n\\nThis news comes out and the stock increase in value. A few days later, as short interest increases in the company, Shkreli decides to no longer lend the shares. Remember how I said shares needed to be borrowed from someone. That someone is a lender who has a large quantity of shares that they don't plan to necessarily immediately move. I don't know if Shkreli intentionally had his shares up for lending, if it was done unintentionally by his prime broker because the shares were marked as marginable, or through any other plausible method, but Shkreli stopped allowing his shared to be lended out. This reduced the available shares outstanding from 4.1 Million Shares that could be borrowed against to 1.13 Million Shares that could be borrowed against. Now, people are trying to figure out what's going on with the value of the company since such a small amount of shares can be viably traded. All the while, there is no indication of what is going on inside KBIO yet, but that is due to the fact that at 15 days old, there is still a great deal of potential work that is being done to get a deal worked out for short term funding, etc.\"),\n",

Simply speaking there are 3 main parties to this, shareholders, management and the government. \\n\\nShareholders want to see the price of a stock go up. The higher it goes the more they can sell it for when they retire, or cash out to buy a home a car or something. Shareholders generally have no real reason to see the price go down. \\n\\nCompany management like wise have little motivation in seeing the price of their stock go down. The higher it is, the more successful their company looks, the better rewards they'll receive for creating value for the company/ shareholders. Management is generally not interested in seeing the stock price fall.\\n\\nShareholders and management in China are similar in their motivation to shareholders and management in the US. No one wants to see their portfolio/ stock price fall. The difference is the ability to profit from incorrect pricing. It is easier outside of China to recognize and profit from errors in stock pricing. This will tend to push stock prices down to generally accepted true value.\\n\\nBut where does the government fit in? The value of companies to governments is usually a source of pride, or a badge of success, and while governments would like to create environments where companies can succeed, and they usually don't get too involved. However, in China it is more than that. The government is actively involved in companies. The Chinese government owns many companies and has a stake in others. Party members can be appointed on the board or in leadership positions within companies. The government is the management and the shareholders. So are they motivated to see the price of stocks fall? \\n\\nBetting against state owned companies in such an environment could easily be seen as antagonistic towards the government and state. This could easily scare off the people who would have the knowledge and ability to do so. If you know a state owned company is over-priced but think you'll suffer some type of penalty or censure if you make a move against it, is it really worth the trouble? Why not park your money somewhere you feel is safer and let it remain someone else's problem? \\n\\nAs a result of this environment many stocks prices have climbed to prices they don't belong and people aren't sure where they should have been. So everyone is trying to sell off their stock and save what is left of their investment. There are price bubbles all over the world in many different forms varying from beanie babies to housing securities. The market and government are yet to figure out an accurate way to predict and prepare for them. That being said, there are ways to mitigate and warn. Primarily this is through independent analysis of stocks and companies. Many investment firms have analysts that go through a company's statements and records in order to figure out the truthfulness of those records and ascertain the company's value. Smaller companies may pay organizations like Bloomberg or Zachs to conduct an analysis of their own company to provide transparency to their stock holders (not entirely independent, agreed). \\n\\nThe point is, the ability to independently analyse companies without repercussions, and to act on that analysis helps to avoid and soften the blow. A Chinese stock market isn't simply a matter of national pride, its a matter of control. The Chinese government maintains tight control of their currency and routinely interferes in the stock market, which along with penalties for non-positive feedback makes analysis difficult and unreliable.\\n\\nEDIT TLDR: Prices are too high, no one knows what the price should be so everyone is selling their stock.\"),\n",

But apparently once the hives are established they produce enough honey that he will get some free honey out of the deal.\"),\n",

       "  'The UK does have constitutional laws -- what it doesn\\'t have is a single document called \"the Constitution\".\\n\\nAny organization\\'s constitution is the set of rules which dictate how that organization is to be run and exactly what its ruling body can and can\\'t do -- and a country\\'s constitution is no different. It\\'s just that, in the UK, these laws are found scattered about the place, and there are also various protocols, traditions and regulations that are all part of the constitution.\\n\\nAn important reason for that is that there has been no radical change of the system of government recently, and it\\'s very old. The UK isn\\'t like, say, the USA, which was relatively recently founded and on the principle that it should be very different from the way Old World countries were run; or Germany, which only became a nation state in 1871 and has had to start from scratch several times since then -- most recently following the Second World War (the current German constitution, called the \"Basic Law\", came into effect in 1949).\\n\\nThe British constitution has simply evolved over time, pretty much uninterrupted, from \"Do whatever the king tells you to do\" to the current model of \"Do whatever the king tells you to do, except that the king is only allowed to tell you to do things the democratically elected government has decided upon.\" One of the most famous (but not, contrary to what Americans are usually taught in schools, the most important) steps in that process was the Magna Carta of 1215, a treaty signed by the truly awful King John in which he agreed not to be quite so horrible to his barons. Since then, new treaties, laws and traditions have come into being and now have the force of constitutional law. At no point was there a meeting at which legal experts drew up a document called \"The Constitution\".\\n\\nThis does mean that the constitution can be changed with relative ease. In some countries, a change to the constitution will require something like a 2/3 majority and/or a referendum to pass, for example. In Britain, a simple Act of Parliament can change the constitution: for example, in 2010, a law was passed fixing the parliamentary term at five years -- previously, a government could call an election at any time within five years. (The latest election was called early, but the law says that\\'s possible if it gets 2/3 majority support, which it did.)\\n\\nThat is quite scary, but the most important parts of constitutional law are beset by all sorts of safeguards which can\\'t be removed quite so easily, and Parliament must observe the rule of law. Recently, for example, the Supreme Court prevented the government from using what\\'s called the \"Royal Prerogative\" to authorize Britain\\'s withdrawal from the EU without Parliamentary approval -- the referendum had made no mention of using the Royal Prerogative, and so a bill had to be introduced, debated and voted on.\\n\\nSome things are technically possible, but very much constitute a nuclear option. In the TV drama *King Charles III*, the king refuses to sign a bill into law, enters the House of Commons and dissolves Parliament. While he could, in theory, do all those things, in reality any one of them would provoke a constitutional crisis and probably end the monarchy (the last time a king walked into the Commons, it started a civil war).\\n\\nAnd it also means that it\\'s often not clear what the constitution says, or even if it says anything at all. At the moment, Britain has a minority government -- there are more MPs on the opposition benches than on the government benches. We\\'ve just had the Queen\\'s Speech, in which the Queen reads out a list of things the government has on its to-do list. This is now being debated, and there will be a vote on it. If the government loses this vote... nobody knows what\\'s supposed to happen. It would show that the current government does not have the support of the House of Commons, but what then? Do we have to have yet another election? Or does the Conservative Party hand over to the Labour Party to try to form a working coalition with some of the other parties? The second option would be a constitutional nightmare, because it would be in effect a regime change without an election, and that\\'s never happened before in the UK. If we take the first option, there\\'s a real risk that the result will be much the same as what we have now.\\n\\nSo yes, there is a constitution. It\\'s just that Britain makes it up as it goes along.'),\n",

Those buildings are using a low sloped roofing system with a EPDM (Ethylene Propylene Diene Monomer).  It\\'s a rubber layer that protects the roof.  The buildings that have a layer of gravel on them use an EPDM that does not have an adhesive side to keep it on the roof. Another that Skeezy hints at but needs to be pointed out is that gravel is used versus some lighter material is to provide weight to hold the roof material down during high winds. Flat semi concrete panels can be used for same purposes as all listed and are more suited for times when roof will be used for higher traffic such as tenant use. Gravel just happens to be a cheap suitable material that provides for a lot of benefits. A flat roof has a rubber membrane adhered to the decking that waterproofs the roof. The roof will also have a slight slope so as to remove water. Gravel serves a couple purposes, 1) to protect the membrane from damage, 2) to provide a flat surface to walk on and place equipment like A/C pumps.'),\n",

That\\'s why the second demo forms a solid pillar as you pour the solution onto the stuff that\\'s crystalized already.\\n\\nETA \\nIf you try it yourself make sure that the equipment is clean, particularly the jar you pour the hot solution into to cool.

By boiling the water, you are able to increase the water\\'s ability to dissolve material. What is happening in the gif is the water is brought to a boil and the maximum amount of material (in this case sodium acetate) is dissolved. This hot solution of water and sodium acetate is transferred to the glass container to cool down. Once the solution has cooled down it contains more sodium acetate than it normally would be able to dissolve while at room temperature. This is called \"supersaturated.\" Supersaturated solutions are really good at growing crystals. Once a small amount of sodium acetate left over from the bottom of the pan is placed in the supersaturated solution (in the gif this is a small crystal on the end of the wooden dowel) the sodium acetate in solution begins to crystalize. \\n\\nTLDR: Boiling water can dissolve more material than cold water.

So anything the government has to pay for ultimately has to be funded through taxes.\\n\\nOf course the government can borrow money or save up from year to year to smooth out bumps, so the tax rate doesn\\'t have to be adjusted constantly, but yes, ultimately, if the government spends more money than it is paid in taxes, tax rates will eventually have to go up (or tax revenue has to grow by other means: if you can make the economy grow so people earn and spend more, everyone will pay more money in taxes even if the tax rate stays the same)\\n\\nBut what people who say \"the taxpayers will have to pay for it\" often forget is that taxpayers have to pay *anyway*. Taking health care as an example, you either pay taxes which are used to fund the health care system, or you don\\'t, in which case you have to pay health care providers directly. You end up paying regardless. The cost doesn\\'t go away just because it\\'s not paid for via taxes. Government is a service. The taxpayer is the served entity. Taxes are the means of payment. Governments have literally zero other income.\\n\\nNow you have probably been (mis)taught to think of government as a burden, but that\\'s typically (in \"the west\") a illusion brought about by the fact that neither you, nor anybody you\\'ve likely spoken to at length, have ever lived outside of the protection of a government.\\n\\nSo every day you are privileged to _not_ need to step over starved corpses while dodging swarms of beggar children. When you turn on the taps there is usually water. When you turn on the switch there\\'s usually light. The roads between home and whatever destination have a relatively reasonable level of wear and a minimal level of threat. You don\\'t pay two-thirds of your income to a local warlord. That sort of thing.\\n\\nSo we pay taxes and fees under force of law because people are generally too stupid to fully understand why, if they live in city-A, the quality of roads in city-B may be vital to their survival.\\n\\nBasically people _want_ \"pay as you go\" (toll roads and such) to be true because they don\\'t understand where their goods and services have been.\\n\\nBut I digress.\\n\\nSo your government doesn\\'t have a stock portfolio. It\\'s not independently wealthy. You, me, all of us pay for every single thing our government does. The government has to take in money to pay for every salary and paperclip and photocopy just like you and your job do.\\n\\nNothing is free.\\n\\nSo the government wants you to make as much money as you can make, because for every dollar you earn, they get thirty cents or so. If they can double your income they double their own.\\n\\nSo if someone needs the government to do anything for them, then the government pays for that out of the government\\'s bank accounts, or by taking a loan.\\n\\nAnd just like you personally, if the government takes a loan today they still have to pay for things tomorrow, but now they also have a loan payment to make.\\n\\nSo generally the taxes you pay are based on what you earn, not the expenses the government has. It would be impossible to tune the monthly and yearly tax rates to the actual expenses.\\n\\nInstead, in an expensive year, loans are taken out. In a frugal year loans are repaid and \"surpluses\" arise.\\n\\nNow we, in the U.S. of late have had a problem. It is _popular_ to promise \"no new taxes\", as in no increases in taxation. But it\\'s not _healthy_ to keep taking loans.\\n\\nSo various people in government promise to \"make up the difference\" by cutting various programs. But all those programs came into existence for one reason or another. You cut \"meals on wheels\" and those cuts are measured in starving senior citizens.\\n\\nSo people, again, being stupid about understanding what they are actually getting for any particular dollar, think saving XXX dollars from some social program is \"a bargain\" because _they_ \"don\\'t need\" that program.\\n\\nBut the system is actually sort of fragile. Every time you starve one guy, you are giving that guy a motive to violate the social contract just to feed himself and his family.\\n\\nMeanwhile, if you cut this other program, say a defense contract, then some corporation might lay off five thousand people, and that cut then take the income tax from five thousand people out of the tax base and maybe even costs the taxpayer for their unemployment and food stamp benefits. And if they lose their houses then the mortgage loss insurance comes out of the tax income _and_ the property values go down costing property tax income.\\n\\nMeanwhile, some political interests \"cheat\". The entire middle-east war under G.W. was kept out of the official budget for nearly seven years. So a lot of loans were taken out but then the next president had to pay the bill instead.\\n\\nSo just like someone trying to scam extra time out of the power company by \"forgetting\" to sign the check they sent, there are various interests in various government offices that are trying to hide or shift blame for various expenses.\\n\\nSo there\\'s all these forces and people of varying interests and agendas and they all want their \"absolutely necessary\" programs to get funding, and they all disparage someone else\\'s \"absolutely necessary\" programs because, as stated, the average person has no clue what they are getting for their tax dollar.\\n\\nThe public spends hours and hours chasing pennies while billions of dollars flow around unnoticed.\\n\\nBut at the core, _eventually_ everything is paid for in tax dollars collected from tax payers.\\n\\nEVERYTHING.\\n\\nSo the various tax cuts and schemes come out of peoples pockets in the end.\\n\\nFor example, the whole \"trickle down economics\" scam was predicated on the idea that if we stopped asking the very rich for more money, the money the got to keep would end up employing \"more people\" and so raising the total tax collected. Unfortunately the truth is that the very rich don\\'t spend all their money every month the way the very poor do. And if they get close they buy more expensive equipment. But that more expensive stuff took the same number of people to make. The guy pressing out the expensive brushed steel case makes about the same amount of money as the guy pressing out the cheap plastic case.\\n\\nSo the government wants as many people to have the best jobs possible.\\n\\nAnd lots of people have theories about how to get that maximum number of people in the best paying jobs possible.\\n\\nBut a lot of those theories don\\'t make any sense. Like doubling the number of people working at Wal Mart doesn\\'t do any good if the average Wal Mart employee needs to be on food stamps. And keeping the minimum wage so low that the average minimum wage worker doesn\\'t pay any taxes is a bum deal as well.\\n\\nOther jokes are the resistance to \"free\" healthcare.

And unless you're on a bridge or in a tunnel you don't need much warning. You just need to side step the train, not out run it.\\n\\nSource: played on a lot of tracks as a kid and still have a stash of flattened coins. It's like running across a road. \\n\\nThe dangerous part comes from tripping or getting stuck.\\n\\nYes, you can hear the train from quite far away, but that's little help if you can't move. Well, we have to keep in mind that most statistics when it comes to railroad fatalities are somewhat skewed as they often also include people who purposely threw themselves in front of the train. Which would therefore not paint an entirely correct picture re: the danger for the average person who is walking on the track trying not to die.\\n\\nThat said there are some reasons why average people might not notice a train coming. Impairment is a big one (drugs, alcohol, hell, even something like noise-cancelling headphones can do it). There is the fact that most modern trains are not always *that* loud anymore, so some people don't notice them until they are too late. Sometimes there are two trains on parallel tracks at the same time, and the noise of one train will cover the noise of the second train, which leads to people getting out of the way of train A, then getting hit by train B as it passes them on the other track. Sometimes natural features of the landscape (such as a thick line of trees or a mountain pass) can distort the noise, catching people unaware of it until it is too late.\\n\\nReally though, there is absolutely no fucking reason for anyone to be on the tracks except terminal stupidity, so just keep your ass off them and save some poor driver the horror of having to wipe someone's splattered guts off their window. Modern high speed trains do no make a lot of noise (listen for example to _URL_0_). \\n\\nAnd (at least in europe) they are going quite fast, so even when you do hear them you only have seconds to move out of the way. And due to the Doppler effect the sound you hear isn't directly associated with a train in your brain but rather a high whistle. You can prolly notice the train the best because the tracks start to hum, but if you don't associate that with a train you could be dead in a few seconds.\\n\\nA train driver might sound the horn, but if he's on a long track and just staring ahead, you might very well be in his blind spot and he won't notice you until he's a few hundred meters away. A train traveling at 250km/h only needs 5 seconds to travel 350 meters and you won't hear it at that distance, especially not if it isn't a straight track or it is lined with trees.\\n\\nAnd the best reason to avoid train tracks: You will scare the train driver to death every time he sees you walking between the tracks and he has to apply the emergency brakes, blow the whistle (and if he's smart he'll look away in the last few seconds). He doesn't know if you're trying to commit suicide or if you are just plain stupid. Crossing tracks just before a train or even worse; walking on train tracks can give those drivers serious mental issues, especially when they did run over someone before. I had no idea so many people are hurt each year. \\n\\nOne danger is from listening to headphones. Another is having two trains passing each other- you may only see one of them. This happened to someone I know who was waiting at a crossing and as soon as a train passed he ran across and got killed by a train going the other way. \\n\\n_URL_1_ Evidently, no they can't.

The name gerrymandering comes from when the governor of Massachusetts (Elbridge Gerry) and his party drew some odd looking districts in order to make sure that his party had a majority in most of them.

       "  \"Yes you can keep your company to yourself. There is no requirement to 'go public' - meaning offer investors shares. The downside as others have pointed out, is this restricts your ability to grow the business based on capital. There's a way around this that's used by several companies, notably Newscorp among others. You issue non voting shares. These are shares that entitle the owner to a share of the company profits, but not a say in how the company is run. This lets you keep control, but you do need to share the profits. Not all big business are made into Corporations (this is what I assume you mean by company). There are a variety of other business organizations such as partnerships and the like, some of which are effectively huge multi nationals (some law firms for example). Generally speaking though, the board is not allowed to make day to day managing decisions of a company, so most CEO's generally have the power to hire people and do stuff.\\n\\nPeople have mentioned the issues of raising capital. There are two ways to do that, take out a loan from a bank or to sell shares, which is a form of ownership, (i.e. stock) in your company. There are a variety of reasons to do one over the other, but the general considerations are money and speed. Getting a loan from a bank has different tax implications over putting out stock. Furthermore, loans can become increasingly more expensive (that is the interest rate grows higher and higher the more loans you take out). \\n\\nThe biggest reason though is likely a liability one. If you are truly the sole owner of the company (that is you own 100% or nearly 100% of a company, and you run it) when it comes to the law, the courts might decide your company doesn't really exist and pass through it. So let's say you are super rich and have 100 million dollars in liquid assets and you start a really awesome tech company selling smart phones. But, you get sued by Apple who brings in their hot shot patent lawyers and annihilate you in court. The court decides you need to pay apple 300 million in damages. Congrats, you are now completely broke and personally owe apple an additional 200 million, so you'd probably have to sell off any additional assets you had, and then declare bankruptcy etc etc.. If you had a company that was legally a corporation your personal money would be more effectively insulated against something like that. \\n\\nEdit: wrote 5 instead of % I think most of the time it started with greed and ended with miscalculation. So they sold 49% of their business and thought they would stay in control with their 51% so no problem and they got good money for the 49%. But later on a simple fight in the family might result in someone selling their shares and the control is lost. Happens very often. If you were to base the company purely on your own equity you would have some problems with growth. At some point you will find out that you could do much better if you managed to double the size of your business. However to increase the size of your business you need capital. If you were to grow naturally all the capital needs to come from your revenue. However this can be a slow process. It might take ten years for you to make enough money to buy that additional location. However there is another option. You can take on new investors. They pay for the new location and you split the earnings. This means that you can start making more money right now and does not have to wait for decades to expand. However this does open up the possibility of hostile takeovers. But as long as you do a good job this will not happen. Sure but to get to that point you generally need investment from outside sources to run your company. Even when it is profitable a lot of that profit is tied up in the business and you may need liquid assets to invest in new areas. People aren't just going to hand you the money they want something in return, normally this is a % of the company and any profits it makes. Keep doing this and growing your business and you can soon find yourself in a position where you don't own a single majority.

It ballooned in size, and suddenly city planners realized that the whole area wasn't such a great place to build a metropolis in after all.  They built levies which could withstand crazy pressure and force.  Just not, you know, a Category 5 hurricane's storm surge kind of force -- no one expected that it was going to be that strong. Native New Orlenean here\\n\\nThe story they told us growing up was that France wanted to build a  port at the mouth of the Mississippi to control shipping.  Unfortunately, there are literally hundreds of miles of swamps in the Mississippi delta so they had trouble finding a place to build.  As I recall, they basically sent two dudes named Iberville and Bienville upriver in a boat and they just got out every now and then to see if the ground was still squishy or not.  Eventually, they came to a bend in the river with a natural levee that was high enough to be relatively safe for building. \\n\\nIt's always struck me as a funny story but it's not as totally stupid as it sounds once you start looking into the local geography.  First off, the original settlement (otherwise known as the French Quarter) is actually about 3 feet above sea level and, while I think some parts of it went into the river in the early days, to my knowledge it's never been totally wiped out by a flood before.   Now, that isn't to say there wasn't some engineering involved in keeping it from flooding but the French Quarter itself isn't that hard to keep dry compared to other parts of the city.\\n\\nFlooding only becomes a serious issue (relatively speaking) when you start moving into some of the outlying communities.  As the population grew, they drained and filled swamps and built on land that is at or below sea level.  Since those areas lie between the natural levees surrounding the river and Lake Ponchartrain, they're in a giant bowl that collects water every time it rains.  The only way to get rid of that water is with a system of canals and giant honking pumps.  Also, the soil has a really high organic content (dead stuff) which compacts very quickly and makes the ground sink even more.  There are some neighborhoods where people have to fill in their yards and replace their driveways on a regular basis because the houses are on pilings, and thus do not move, but the yard and driveways keep sinking. (Real estate tip:  If you're thinking of moving to New Orleans, do not buy one of those houses)\\n\\nAs for why people built on such obviously substandard land... You have to keep in mind that New Orleans is one of the oldest cities in the country.  They didn't plan it out like a retirement community in Florida.  They just did what they could to meet the demands of a growing population and tried to make it as safe as possible by installing pumps and canals to keep the low lying areas dry.  People who live there, stay there because their families live there and, frankly, because it's an AWESOME place to live.  If I ever move back, I'll definitely buy a house above sea level but the flooding risk is worth the cultural rewards in all but the most irresponsibly planned developments.  \\n\\nEDIT:  I also want to mention that many cities are built in inherently dangerous locations.  In the US alone, New Orleans, Miami, New York, San Francisco, LA, Seattle, St. Louis, and Memphis are all built in vulnerable locations for one reason or another, and most of those have been constructed in ways that make them even more vulnerable to their particular Achilles heel.\"),\n",

Black holes have a lot of mystique and awe around them, but they really aren\\'t that complicated. If you live somewhere with snow, you have probably played around with the basic concepts.\\n\\n\\n\\nImagine we start with a cloud. It is really big.\\n\\nThen the cloud gets compacted. Parts of the cloud condense. It turns into snowflakes. Same amount of stuff, smaller space. The snow falls to the ground. What was once a very large part of cloud has the same mass, but is now a smaller pile of snow.\\n\\nThen you compact it some more. You start with a small pile of snow, compress it, and you have a snowball.  Same amount of stuff, smaller space. It might be the size of a baseball.\\n\\nCompact it some more, you have a small iceball. It might be the size of a golf ball. Same amount of stuff, smaller space.\\n\\nThat is exactly what happens with a black hole.\\n\\nThe same is true for planets and for stars, black holes, and even the super massive black holes in a galactic core.\\n\\nLet\\'s see how.\\n\\nStart with a big gas nebula.  It can be hundreds of millions of miles across. But it is very sparse, like a cloud.\\n\\nCollapse part of the nebula and you get a star, some planets, asteroids, comets, and other material. It is much like collapsing your cloud to snowflakes. Perhaps a big star, perhaps a yellow giant or a blue hypergiant. Let\\'s say it is a 10 million mile diameter yellow giant. The Sun is about one million miles across for comparison.\\n\\nPush and compact a giant star and eventually it will collapse into a neutron star. Just like collapsing your pile of snow into a snowball.  It is very small and whitish, but has the same amount of stuff as the star before it.  It has the same amount of gravity, just squished a bit more.  The star collapses from roughly ten million miles down to roughly five miles. It shrinks to about a millionth of the size, but it still has the same amount of mass. The planets and other objects will still orbit at the same distance, assuming they survived the giant explosion that took place when it collapsed. When you read online about a supernova, it can be caused by one of the giant stars collapsing this way.\\n\\nThe big difference with a neutron star is that since it is compressed so much, it shrunk from ten million miles to just five miles, things can get MUCH closer to the central mass. If a comet or asteroid or planet gets too close, it won\\'t be able to escape and will eventually crash into the star. Other than that, it still has the same amount of mass, the same amount of gravity, the same amount of matter that the giant star had.  It is just squished together tighter.\\n\\n\\nCollapse it again and it turns into a black hole. It still has the same gravity, but because it has collapsed the things near the center are able to get closer to the central mass.  What started as a ten million mile star, or a hundred million mile nebula, or a five mile neutron star, has been squished down to the size of a large marble, probably just a few inches across. It still has the same amount of stuff in it, and again any nearby planets or other objects orbiting it that survive the explosion will continue to orbit exactly the same.\\n\\nIt gets so small, so tight, that now stuff that could have only come within a few miles of it can now come within inches of it.  Just like before, things that get too close cannot escape, and will eventually crash into the star. The difference is that at some distance near the star, perhaps only a mile or two away from the tiny marble, not even light can escape directly. But these very tiny objects still have the same mass, 10^32 or 10^33 kg of mass, just squished down really tight.\\n\\nBlack holes are just really squished stars. A cloud that was once millions of miles across has been squished down to the size of a marble. They still move around, they still do what stars do, they are still just a really tightly compacted iceball. The only difference between a black hole and a star is they are just so squished that light has a hard time escaping.  \\n\\n\\nAnyway, the centers of galaxies are super massive black holes.  They are like thousands of stars that have been squished down, just like you can squash a whole yard worth of snow into one snowman. The stars are squished and squished and squished, maybe down to the size of a basketball or the size of a small building. They might have a mass of 10^36 kg, give or take an order of magnitude. They have so much mass that millions of stars (including black holes) orbit around them. These galactic cores also move around.\\n\\nWe have a local cluster of galaxies that are all moving around.  The galactic cores, those collections of super massive black holes, are moving in their own dance around the universe.  We have the Canis Major Galaxy, and the Sagittarius Dwarf Elliptical Galaxy, that are already crashing into the Milky Way Galaxy. We are on a collision course with another, the Andromeda Galaxy. It was just on the news that scientists updated when the Milky Way is expected to crash into Andromeda. We still have around 3 billion years, so we\\'ll be long dead, but our Sun will likely entering old age when the Milky Way collides with Andromeda and will probably become a big elliptical galaxy. \\n\\nOur local cluster of galaxies is part of an even larger dance with other clusters of galaxies, all moving around crashing into each other. Note: Movement through space is entirely relativistic. One can only determine the movement of objects in relation with another object. For example , on Earth , if we were to observe the universe , we would come to a conclusion that we are stationary - that we are not moving in space, and that everything else is. The same goes for black holes. If one were to observe the universe at the location of a black hole , one would conclude that it too, like the previous observation , is stationary, and that other objects are rotating around it. \\n\\nTherefore, as to wether or not black holes are moving through space depends on the perspective in which one is observing through. A few misconceptions here.\\n\\nFirst, the expansion of the universe is not motion.  It\\'s space itself that expands, not objects that move through space.  You can think of it as two ants on an inflating balloon: even if the ants don\\'t move, the distance between them will increase.  Similarly  it\\'s possible for two black holes to drift apart due to space expansion, while staying \"motionless\".  But that leads to our second point:\\n\\nThere is no such thing as a motionless reference in the universe.  There is no favored reference frame to which you can compare objects and determine if they are moving or not.  There is nothing you can anchor to.  It\\'s all relative.  A black hole that is motionless relatively to a specific reference frame will be moving compared to an infinity of other equally valid reference frames.\\n\\nThird, mass doesn\\'t prevent *motion*, it only makes *acceleration* more difficult.  That is, a black hole that is moving will keep moving at the same pace until you apply a force to it.  Also the mass of black holes may be very big but it is not infinite, meaning a force applied to it will have a small effect, but it will have an effect.'),\n",

It's enough to break down food to a degree that the rest of our digestive system can cope with it, but it can't kill all the types of bacteria that cause food poisoning.

By comparison a dog's stomach acid is 10x stronger than a human's, and its intestines are only a couple times its body length.

And it\\'s easy to sell it as a big, world shaping event. \\n\\nWhen done well, it can be profitable, but few places do it well. \\n\\nToss in a good dose of bribes and political pandering and you\\'ve got yourself a recipe for economic disturbances of olympic proportions. Main reason is that it essentially subsidized additional infrastructure. If a country wants to make stadiums, transportation improvements, ect, for their public’s general use (not just Olympic use), then it will cost them, hosting the olympics or not. However by hosting said olympics, they at least get a bit more revenue for more or less the same amount of money they would spend on infrastructure without the olympics, meaning the bill would be less.\\n\\nOr you have corrupt countries with corrupt politicians. Like Brazil, where said infrastructure was more or less abandoned after the olympics. It is almost never directly profitable.  But sometimes it can have indirect benefits.  Salt Lake City might have lost money in the short term, but showing the world you are a great ski destination is probably still earning them benefits today.\\n\\nA lot of it comes down to prestige.  The Olympics makes places like Lake Placid and Lillehammer household names, doubly so if they pull them off well.  Often an advanced developing country, like say Brazil, will see hosting as a step towards sitting at the grown-up table in international affairs.  Unfortunately, they will often overreach and make bids too favorable to the IOC, resulting in an event thing can\\'t afford.  This also can result in a poorly executed event that actually hurts their prestige.  \\n\\nAlso, the IOC has a pretty extensive history of corruption when it comes Olympic bids.  The games are sometimes are awarded to countries who can only host them with great hardship, so long as the right people got paid off.  Then corrupt politicians find ways to divert all the government money being spent into their own pockets.  That is part of the reason only highly developed countries are able to break even.  They already have much of the needed infrastructure and less corruption, which reduces costs significantly.  A country like Germany could probably throw the games together in half the time for significantly less expense. Event - Hosted the Olympics - -1000 Ducats / Gain Prestige +50. (if you play EU4 this will make sense)\\n\\nBecause of the prestige and opportunity to show off to the rest of the world.  The Olympics is something only \"big boy\" countries get to host.  If you aren\\'t in the conversation for the Olympics you are basically a nobody internationally. I remember once that someone proposed a permanent Olympic Village somewhere in the north. All Olympic games, Summer and Winter, would take place there. It would be a neutral area, the country who hosts the next Olympics takes it over between the actual Olympics, maintains it for those four years (and takes in all the inevitable tourist/resort money in the process) in between games, and improves upon the facilities if necessary. No one lives there full time except for Olympic Comittee officials. So, doping scandals like Sochi have less chances of happening because the facilities are group owned and people can spot differences once the torch passes hands and the facility is given to the next country.\\n\\nEdit: And so messes like the Rio Summer games don\\'t happen again. Never underestimate the power of corruption. Hosting an olympics requires building stadiums, housing, and public transit. That costs billions of dollars. The contractors who get paid to do the building buy off the politicians who give them the contracts. That’s assuming that the contracts aren’t just handed out to close friends and family. Olympics were a net positive for Vancouver.  Sure , expensive , but a lot of that was infrastructure we still enjoy today \\n\\n   And we are a tourist city, so we likely get dividends paid back yearly. It\\'s like a coming out party for some.

Whenever women have more than one baby at the time, statistically those babies tend to be born earlier (pre-term labour is more common in multiples) and at lower birth weight. Which is something we can deal with now, but throughout most of our history, when many children already died very young, that would've put those kids at a disadvantage. When you start talking triplets or more, the chances of those kids dying or being born with disabilities goes up a lot. Which again, is something we might be able to handle now, but not so much for most of our history.\\n\\nThen once they are born and have survived that, human babies require a lot of nurturing. This is because they are born relatively underdeveloped. Being able to focus your attention, resources and protection on one infant at a time is optimal if you need to put in a lot of nurturing. Most animals with young that need a lot of nurturing during their early life (such as our close primate cousins and elephants) tend to only have one young at a time. This increases the chances of that one infant making it to adulthood. \\n\\nedit: wanted to edit to add that what this describes is K-reproductive strategy. Which in essence comes down to quality over quantity AKA these animals don't have many young, but they take such good care of their young that many will still make it to adulthood. This in contrast to r-reproductive strategy which many other animals use which comes down to quantity over quality - aka I cannot guarantee my babies will make it to adulthood, so I will just have lots of them to beat the odds.\"),\n",

       "  'Everything on Earth is poisonous if you ingest too much of it.  The question is what constitutes a lethal dosage.  A very small organism, such as a bacteria, can be killed with a relatively small amount of alcohol.  A larger organism, like a human, requires a larger dose.  We also have organs like the liver that help process the poison out of our bodies.  So even if the alcohol doesn’t hurt a human, it does kill bacteria in your mouth on the way down.\\n\\nThe thing is, alcohol DOES hurt humans.  A lot.  You know how people vomit when they become intoxicated?  That’s the body’s way or recognizing that it ingested too much of an unpleasant substance and needs to expel it from the body.  If a person drinks too much in one sitting, they absolutely will die.  If a person drinks large amounts over time, it will damage the liver and can lead to other health problems. Alcohol is like a poison. The initial disorienting side affects we enjoy (along with some health benefits from controlled consumption)\\n\\nIt does cause harm. That\\'s why people get sick and even die from heavy or long term use of alcohol. It can cause permanent damage to organs like the liver, ulcers, and dependency to the point of self destruction. The alcohol you put on a cut and the alcohol you drink are not the same thing. \\n\\nThere are many types of alcohol that are all chemically different and that are used for different things but it seems that you are asking about isopropyl alcohol and ethyl alcohol specifically. \\n\\nIsopropyl alcohol (the kind you put on a cut) breaks down the fat and protein membrane that surrounds cells. There is no way for the alcohol to determine what is a human cell and what is a bacteria, so when you clean a wound with isopropyl alcohol you are also destroying some of your own cells in the process. This is why wounds cleaned with alcohol will often heal slower and leave bigger scars than wounds that are just washed with soap and water. Isopropyl alcohol is highly toxic when consumed because your body does not have a way to break it down and eliminate it without creating more toxic substances in the process.\\n\\nThe kind of alcohol you drink is called ethyl alcohol (sometimes you will see it abbreviated ETOH). This type of alcohol is a waste product of aerobic (requires oxygen) metabolism of yeast. Ethyl alcohol IS toxic if ingested, however, our bodies produce an enzyme that allows us to process it without producing any additional toxic substances. The reason you get the euphoric effects from ethyl alcohol is that it is able to cross the blood brain barrier before it is broken down because this enzyme takes a long time to work and your body only has a limited amount to work with.  If it\\'s ever destroyed (usually as a result of long term alcohol abuse) your body can\\'t make more and will not be able to process and eliminate the alcohol.\\n\\nTL;DR: All alcohol is toxic. Our bodies produce an enzyme that breaks down ethyl alcohol, but not other types of alcohol. Even ethyl alcohol can kill us if we ingest more than our bodies can process. IT depends on the concentration. \\n\\nBrewer\\'s yeasts are living things, and they create alcohol to make the mixture toxic for other yeasts and bacteria, so they will have the food supply all to themselves. Similar to how others produce vinegar, to make the mix too acidic for other life forms.\\n\\nMake a strong alcohol mix, and soak yourself in it for long enough, and you will find yourself just as dead as those bacteria. But, unlike bacteria, we have a layer of dead skin on the outside, which protects the living cells beneath it. And a lot of the sensation of drinking strong spirits is the toxic, destructive effects of the alcohol on the relatively unprotected cells in the lining of your mouth and throat.

So if an IT admin wants to change a security setting on 10,000 browsers in the company, he can do it all from his desk.\\n* If everyone uses the same browser, the IT admin can simply be an expert in troubleshooting that one browser which makes fixing problems easier.\\n\\nHow has the situation changed recently?\\n\\n* IE 9 is widely regarded to be a vast improvement over its predecessors in terms of speed and security.

       " (\"How is it that very complex 10-hour seasons of TV shows can be produced in a year's time, yet 2-hour movies so often take years to produce?\",\n",
       "  'A lot of it is setup that takes place before any production begins - hiring people, finding actors, locations, etc. A tv show has to do that just once - just like in movies, except they get to reuse all of those resources in every episode. I\\'ve worked on both feature films and TV shows, and I can give you the answer in one word: Post-production.\\n\\nYes, features tend to shoot at a much slower pace, but production generally accounts for a relatively small percentage of overall time spent on a project. The biggest difference is when it comes to editing. A feature will often spend several months just in editing. First, the editor will get a first cut up and running, which can take a couple of weeks past the end of shooting. Then the director will come in and make changes—this can take weeks to several months. Often the producers will also chime in, and sometimes (especially if it\\'s a new, unestablished director), they will exercise creative control over the project, and a lot of horse trading goes on between the director and the producers (and on bigger projects, the studio gets input as well) over what the final cut will look like.\\n\\nWhile this is going on, there\\'s a lot of other stuff that\\'s just getting started. Visual effects are being planned out, bid out to companies, sent out, reviewed, and so on. This usually doesn\\'t even start to happen until well into the editorial process. Music is being decided on. Composers are being interviewed, and then the music has to actually be written. Existing music has to be licensed. The sound design is starting to take form.\\n\\nAt this point, there\\'s often audience testing, which is generally a huge waste of time and effort, but producers and studios insist on doing it anyway. And what\\'s worse is they\\'ll make changes, often substantial ones, based on the opinion of between 20 and 300 people who just watched a rough, unfinished version of the movie with temp music, sound effects, VFX shots, and so on. A movie that tests poorly can sometimes drag on for several months as changes are made, or maybe they\\'ll even do a week or two of reshooting.\\n\\nFinally, the picture is locked, which means that they\\'re done editing. Now the sound design really begins. Dialogue lines are cleaned up, or selected to be re-recorded and replaced (this is called ADR). Sound effects are added, and music is scored and put into the film. Meanwhile, the picture is being brought “online”—they take the cut and recreate it from the high quality raw footage, as opposed to the lower quality “offline” media that was used to edit the film. The director of photography will usually come in and oversee the color correction process. Final visual effect shots will be inserted. This whole process (picture and sound) can take as much as a month or two, sometimes even more if it\\'s a really complicated film.\\n\\nLastly, it all comes together at the final mix. The online picture is taken and played back against the final sound design, and levels are adjusted, sound effects and such that are deemed extraneous are removed, tweaks to the music are made, and the movie looks and sounds the best it ever will. All in all, it\\'s taken a minimum of six months of post-production to get here, and a year or more is not unheard of. \\n\\nThe thing is, I\\'ve very rarely heard of a movie locking picture and finishing without any further changes. I\\'ve worked on films that have changed literally dozens of times after picture was supposedly “locked”. Each change lengthens the overall process by at least a day or two, and sometimes as much as several weeks if the changes are fairly substantial. Those changes add up quickly.\\n\\nThe thing is that there\\'s no real pressure to get the movie done on any reasonable time frame, so everyone wants to take as long as possible to do everything. Why not? There\\'s always more work that can be done, and as long as there\\'s money to keep paying people, you can stave off unemployment for that much longer. As they say, art is never finished, it\\'s abandoned.\\n\\nNow, contrast this to a typical TV series. They\\'ve got an air date, and that\\'s non-negotiable. So everything *has* to get done on a schedule that is backtimed from that air date. The editor\\'s cut for a show might take a day or two, the director gets maybe another day or two, and then the producers (writer-producers are invariably the driving creative force in TV, not directors) come in and lock picture. And that\\'s it. It goes to the sound department, VFX are rushed through, music is added, and the show is put on the air. I\\'ve been on shows that have made changes within a week or two of the airdate, and there\\'s very much a sense of emergency, because things *have* to get done on time. There is no alternative. Not only that, but the pipeline can run in parallel—you can be doing sound and music on one show, while editing another and shooting a third. Often shows will have multiple editors working on different episodes, and unlike in features where editors usually see the movie through the whole process to the final mix, editors are there to edit picture, and *that\\'s it*.\\n\\nThe bottom line is that work expands to fill available time, and since there\\'s a time pressure in TV things get done faster because they have to. There are a number of factors that make it so TV shows can film much more content in a similar (or shorter) period of time; here\\'s a couple of the biggest:\\n\\n1.  Location:  Television shows generally use many fewer sets than movies; both Dramas and Comedies usually put a set of characters usually in 2-3 different places for the duration of an episode, which means less moving around for the production team and the actors.  Often they\\'ll take place indoors, or somewhere that can be simulated on a studio backlot, which lessens the need for things like travel to locations or permits to shoot scenes.  Some movies *thrive* on the exotic \"real-life\" locations they show; think of how many locations are featured in a James Bond movie.\\n\\n2.  People:  Television casts, especially for dramas, are much larger than than a movie.  This means television shows can shoot more scenes at the same time in parallel, with different sets of actors.\\n\\n3. FX: Movies in general have much more involved FX shots.  While something like \"Arrow\" tries to have fights and explosions every week, it pales in comparison to the same fare from something like \"Avengers\".\\n\\nThere are other factors, but these are probably the 3 biggest. Taking them to extremes can contribute to a bunch of both money and time-saving tricks that TV can use, but movies can\\'t.  The [\"ship in a bottle\"](_URL_0_) are probably the most famous example of this, which can still yield great television (the \"Blink\" episode of Doctor Who is a great example of this).  There\\'s no real way to do an equivalent of this with movies; the closest is something like \"The Bourne Legacy\", but changing a principle actor is not usually the solution to a problem of needing more time in the movie business. Movies don\\'t often take that long. Everyone is always doing something, while their may be a few years in between movies, more often than not it\\'s because the producer/actors/directors are doing other projects. Most filming only takes between 1-3 months. The rest of the time it\\'s sitting waiting for post processing and editing, in that time actors do other movies as well. \\n\\nAlso all studios have release boards that give them a projected outlook for movies releasing on specific weekends. It let\\'s them know when to release their movie that will give them the best opportunity to be seen. Meaning that 2 blockbusters won\\'t do well up against each other so they may hold onto the project until a prime weekend shows itself. Because they have to. The priorities are different.\\n\\nTV shows are produced on tight schedules to meet strict deadlines to make specific air dates. Whatever budgets they have are then planned around making the best show they can with the limited amount of time available.\\n\\nFeature films are generally made without such strict time constraints. As a result, the priority shifts from doing everything as fast as possible to spending as much time as you can afford to make everything as perfect as possible.'),\n",

       "  \"The containers are [not always round](_URL_0_), but most tend to have at least rounded corners and edges.\\n\\nThis is mostly a stability issue. Sharp edges is where the pressure would be the worst and the container would break first. Round containers have the pressure distributed more equally. The absence of edges also makes the containers easier to clean. Round containers have more volume for the surface area.  It means that less weight is used in the container and it make them more cost effective. I'm not an engineer, but if I had to guess, I'd say it's because in a round container, as the fluid level drops, the liquid will always be in the bottom and center of the container. If the container had a rectangular base, liquid could get stuck in the corners, which would make it tougher to drain the container. Just like to point out that in the vast majority of applications for liquid hauling trailers volume is not going to be a primary concern. The gross vehicle weight limits will be easily satisfied in the allowable length/height dimensions without worrying about the most efficient volumetric shape.\\n\\nAnd ya, since the fluid will either be pumped or drained out it works best to have the bottom sloped to a common low point, as a cylinder does. Now that vs. say a box with floor sloped to a common point, the cylinder is probably easier to manufacture. Once you factor that the metal goes through a roller, you realize it requires less welding.\\n\\nCan't argue with the strength theory as presented here also. Liquids haul rough, they push back and forth with a shit load of force. Case in point, if a water truck is half loaded and slams on the brakes, once stopped the force of the water in the tank slapping back and forth will push the (~70,000 lb) unit around for a couple minutes\\n\\nSource: Part of my job is hauling water Pressure is also a big one. When heat rises, the liquid inside the containers expand, causing the container to morph shape. If the container was a square then the gases would push on the container's walls making it look like some bizarre square-circle hybrid. On a truck with limited space, you want everything to be as compact as possible, but if one object expands then it's going to disrupt everything. cylinders evenly distribute and withstand internal pressure and will not lose its shape. Because a rectangle isn't strong enough and has more weak points. Asphere isn't cost effective, though stronger at holding liquid, would have more wasted space on an 18 wheeler. A cylinder is the best of both worlds.

       "  \"As much as nedgus wrote, he's not entirely accurate.  The severity of the case of down syndrome depends on how much of the third chromosome is present. Mitosis of the zygote (reproduction of the fertilized egg) chromosome 23 does tend to stick together and not want to separate, but it's also rather fragile, and the extra copy can break, causing that third copy to actually be a fragment. So, technically, people with down syndrome will have any where from 2 and, say 1/16th copies to 2 and 7/8ths (a full third chromosome tends to be fatal). The larger the piece of the third chromosome, the more severe the case, as more proteins are expressed that cause the symptoms. This happens early is embryonic development, and effects ALL cells of the person, not a selected few. If what nedgus is explaining were true, you'd have people with suited syndrome in like, half of they body, but not the other half. \\n\\nCredibility: I hold a bachelor's in biology with a focus on human genetics and evolution. From what I understand, it depends on the point in development that you get the production of cells with the extra chromosome. \\n\\nFirst, you have a processed called 'meiosis' that creates mum's eggs and dad's sperm. This is when cells split apart to halve the number of chromosomes they have. This means that mum's chromosomes in the egg can join with dad's chromosome's in the sperm to make the normal number of chromosomes again.\\n\\nUsually, a cell from mum or dad, you or me, would have 46 chromosomes. But each of these are paired up with a friend, so that you have 23 X-shaped friendly chromosome pairs.  \\n\\nDuring meiosis, the friendly chromosome pairs swap some of their genetic information with other friendly chromosome pairs. The cell then divides in two and puts half of the chromosome pairs in one half and the other in the other. But sometimes the friendly chromosomes stick themselves together too tightly and 'nondysjunction' occurs. This means that there are too many chromosomes going into one cell and not enough in the other cell. (This can occur at either Meiosis I or Meiosis II). In this case, all of the cells that then grew from this ovum or spermatozoa would also be given too many chromosomes. This is what happens in Down Syndrome. If cells developed from the cell with too few chromosomes, life doesn't usually develop unless the monosomy is a Turner's syndrome. \\n\\n(Note that there are other ways in which a chromosomal imbalance may develop such as a Robertsonian Translocation)\\n\\nThe main point here is that if the mutation occurs in meiosis, then all of the progeny cells will carry this mutation.\\n\\nIf the mutation occurs in mitosis during the development of the foetus, you're going to get a slightly different outcome. In mitosis, chromosomal imbalance can come about again through a nondysjunction event whereby during the division period some of the chromosomes stick together and aren't distributed properly into the daughter cells.\\n\\nIn this case, only the cells derived from this mutated cell would have the trisomy. The cells that came from normal cells will still be normal. In this case you get a 'mosaic' Down syndrome. This is where some of the cells in the body are mutated and others are not. This leads to a less severe form of Down syndrome because not all cells are affected.\"),\n",

       "  'Okay, so whenever you have your eyes open you can see your nose, right? But most of the time you don\\'t even notice it, only when you actually think about it.\\n\\nYour brain gets a lot of information at the same time. You feel your clothes, see your surroundings and so on, all at the same time. Because it is hard work to save all those informations some stuff gets ignored, just like your nose.\\n\\nNow think of your dreams as the nose. Dreams are not important to your brain after they happened so the memory gets deleted quickly. You can usually remember it for a few minutes after waking up but it goes away quickly. \\n\\nNow, just like you can think about your nose and then see it, you can start thinking about your dreams and keep them memorized! If you concentrate on them, you tell your brain that they are important and it will save them. \\n\\nThis can be trained btw. (I haven\\'t studied memory directly for quite some time, but this is the essence as I remember it)\\n\\nThere are several stages to memory:\\n\\nLong term, episodic memory, this is what we normally think of when we talk about memory; I remember getting up this morning, I remember going on holiday last year, I remember going to the fun fair when I was six.\\n\\nLong term, abstract memory, this is where we store facts. Generally we don\\'t remember where we have learnt something but we remember the information. For example, a formula, the average flight speed of the European swallow, how many Halloween films there are, etc.\\n\\nShort term memory, this is where we can store a small amount of information for a short amount of time. The best example I know if you read a phone number and then your dial it. There is a gap in between reading and dialing where you remember the number, but after it\\'s dialed you no longer remember it.\\n\\nRight now we\\'ve got through that - why do we forget our dreams? The simple answer is they never make it from short term memory to long term memory. They are in the short term memory when we wake up, but they don\\'t get encoded into long term memory so much as the phone number as I was talking about before, we forget them. \\n\\nIf you want to remember your dreams an easy way to encode things into long term memory is through rehearsal - so when you wake up, run through the dream several times in your head or describe it to yourself in detail. Both of these will help encode the dream into your long term memory and mean you remember it later.\\n\\ntl:dr - dreams never make it from short term memory into long term memory. If you want to remember your dreams I recommend keeping some kind of dream journal you write in immediately after waking up from one.  I started doing this a few months ago, going back and reading what I wrote; I can see so many mental images and recall all of them. Just writing them down as if I\\'m explaining them to someone makes them very easy to recall anytime without even reading them. If you\\'re interested in improving your dream recall, you should pay a visit to /r/LucidDreaming! Actually, I\\'ve found a trick.  As soon as I wake up, I can remember my dream for about 2-3 minutes before I forget it.  So if I want to remember it, I\\'ll write down some quick notes, like...\\n\\n\"magical powers\" \"Took over the world\" \"black and red armor\" \"giant castle\"\\n\\nAnd if I go back and look at those notes later, I can remember EVERYTHING about the dream as if it were happening again.\\n\\nBut if I don\\'t take notes... 5 minutes later, I\\'m lucky if I remember \"Uh... I was a knight or something, I think.\"\\n\\ne.g. I have notes written down here from two days ago: \"bridge, ice, driving, Sarah\" and I can remember the dream: I was in the passenger seat of my car, being driven by a friend (Sarah).  We were driving over the Chesapeake Bay bridge, there were no guardrails and the car flew off the side of the bridge.  The bay was completely frozen, and the car landed on its wheels with no damage. We continued to drive as if nothing happened, and I remarked at how much better it was down here than on the bridge because there was no traffic. If you do not have to remember your dreams don\\'t sleep throughout the brain, forget about it. I think sometimes they think they remember well that is the reason why (can nightmare) why sometimes remember but others sometimes don\\'t. It\\'s simple, really. You know logic, right? Of course you do, what a silly question! But what if I told you that you don\\'t *always* know logic?\\n\\nBut I\\'m getting ahead of myself already, let\\'s talk about general memory first, shall we? Good! \\n\\nNow, every time you recall a memory, an electric signal goes through your brain. This sounds scary but it\\'s fine, you\\'re brain is meant to do that. Those electrical signals are quite important.\\n\\nThose signals we call neurons (or so my memory claims, correct me if I\\'m mixing up terms). Neurons have a habbit of inviting their friends, other neurons they often hang out with. They hang out together because they go to the same places, the neurons that hold the name of your best friend and the neurons that hold the face of your best friend usualy go to the conversation with your best friend together.\\n\\nSo what does all this has to do with dreams? Well, not so fast! I\\'m getting there! \\n\\nFirst, think about how you got here, on this threat, on this sub-reddit, on this site, today. What did you do before this? And before that? You can probably remember all the way to this morning if you try hard enough. That\\'s because the neurons who hold those information already started to become friends (or at least know each other a bit) and so, when you ask the neurons of your latest memory to come back and give you a recapp, it will take the neurons from the event before that with him aswell. If you ask him for a recap, he might invite the neurons of the event before that to come too!\\n\\nBut... how is it possible that those neurons already know each other well enough to invite them when you want to remember stuff? Because of logic. There is a special part of your brain dedicated to handeling logic. We trust logic. Every neuron is friends with logic. Thanks to logic, you can recreate the events of your memory, and the things you have forgotten can be filled to some extend thanks to logic. Even if you might not remember getting dressed, if you are wearing clothes. You probably did dress this morning. This \\'realisation\\' might actualy trigger the neurons holding the memory of you putting on your clothes this morning.\\n\\nNow, when you dream, your brain is cleaning up after itself. To do that, it disables the part of your brain that handles logic.\\n\\nThat\\'s right, no logic for you.\\n\\nLet me give you an example of what kind of effects that has during a dream;\\n\\nOnce I dreamt I went through a hallway in an appartment building, I went through a door, did something, and left through that very same door, when I left that room I was on a boat. And the strangest thing is; I didn\\'t thought it was strange at all. My brain did not realize it was strange because it had no concept of logic at the time. \\n\\nNot only that, but in the dream I went right onto the next event. I never really have any moment in my dreams to just do nothing. While I might not remember it, I know I was constantly doing something whereas, while I\\'m writing this very comment, I take a moment every now and then to just sit and think.\\n\\nBy thinking and recalling what I just wrote the neurons holding that information become better friends. Therefor, I\\'m able to remember what I wrote much better because I only have to remember one part and the neurons inviting each other will do the rest.\\n\\nSo yeah, that\\'s basicly it. In your dreams you never take any time to think about what just happened, and therefor the neurons don\\'t really know each other and won\\'t invite each other at the next party. Mr Popular - our logic system - was asleep during your dreams so he can\\'t help you fill in the gabs of your memory because, quite simply, it doesn\\'t make sense what happens in your dreams.\\n\\nThis is why you can\\'t remember your dreams. My theory is that the dream identity is different from the waking identity.  As part of the process of waking up, we put together our identity, which acts as a filter, blocking non-identifiable content.  Dream content is a memory from a slightly different identity.  The you that was being chased by zombies wasn\\'t the waking self.  To help piece together what the waking identity is, it rejects that content, which would confuse you about who you are.  DMT users report a similar phenomenon, that they must write down their experiences quickly or lose them.  It\\'s like early childhood memories; the memories are there but our identity is significantly different as adults and the childhood identities didn\\'t travel with us to adulthood. Your brain cannot tell the difference between dreams and real life.  As as result, your dreams are logged away the same as a waking memory.  The only difference is, your dreams are only logged in your short-term memory.  That\\'s why you can remember them vividly right when you wake up, but then not so much later.\\n\\nDo this: Think hard about a dream you just had right when you wake up.  Play the whole thing through in your mind multiple times.  It will then be logged into your long-term memory, and you will be able to recall it later with ease! You can, indeed, train yourself to lucid dream. If you take Benadryl for your allergies and to help you sleep you may have noticed that you\\'ll remember your dreams better. Benadryl was originally developed as a powerful hypnotic before it was marketed as an antihistamine. That helped me remember and control my dreams, but I wouldn\\'t suggest you start popping those pink pills just for that reason. The comments in this thread are pure brilliance. After all the dreaming is over, after you wake, and leave the world of madness and glory for the mundane day-lit daily grind, through the wreckage of your abandoned fancies walks the sweeper of dreams.\\n\\n\\nWho knows what he was when he was alive? Or if, for that matter, he ever was alive. He certainly will not answer your questions. The sweeper talks little, in his gruff gray voice, and when he does speak it is mostly about the weather and the prospects, victories and defeats of certain sports teams. He despises everyone who is not him.\\n\\n\\nJust as you wake he comes to you, and he sweeps up kingdoms and castles, and angels and owls, mountains and oceans.He sweeps up the lust and the love and the lovers, the sages who are not butterflies, the flowers of meat, the running of the deer and the sinking of the Lusitania. He sweeps up everything you left behind in your dreams, the life you wore, the eyes through which you gazed, the examination paper you were never able to find. One by one he sweeps them away: the sharp-toothed woman who sank her teeth into your face; the nuns in the woods; the dead arm that broke through the tepid water of the bath; the scarlet worms that crawled in your chest when you opened your shirt.\\n\\n\\nHe will sweep it up – everything you left behind when you woke. And then he will burn it, to leave the stage fresh for your dreams tomorrow.\\n\\n\\nTreat him well, if you see him. Be polite with him. Ask him no questions. Applaud his teams\\' victories, commiserate with him over their losses, agree with him about the weather. Give him the respect he feels is his due.\\n\\n\\nFor there are people he no longer visits, the sweeper of dreams, with his hand-rolled cigarettes and his dragon tattoo.\\n\\n\\nYou\\'ve seen them. They have mouths that twitch, and eyes that stare, and they babble and the mewl and they whimper. Some of them walk the cities in ragged clothes, their belongings under their arms. Others of their number are locked in the dark, in places where they can no longer harm themselves or others. They are not mad, or rather, the loss of their sanity is the lesser of their problems. It is worse than madness. They will tell you, if you let them: they are the ones who live, each day, in the wreckage of their dreams. And if the sweeper of dreams leaves you, he will never come back.\\n\\n(Source: Neil Gaiman, Smoke and Mirrors) Survival instinct.\\n\\nWe\\'d all die if our girlfriends remembered how often we cheated in their dreams There are several great responses here.

It\\'s a great book, but it\\'s no easy read. \\n\\nHe explains that the region of the brain activated during REM sleep is the area designated for short term memory. Why your brain operates this way is not known, but it is theorized that since dreams are not actually happening that they are not important to remember. He also explains that you experience a lot of dreams that are anxious and fearful because the area of your brain that is stimulated and the chemicals released are not conducive to calm and peacefulness.\\n\\nEDIT: typos I believe in one bullet point for each year of age when explaining something, so here goes -     \\n*Dreams last for mere seconds before you are dreaming something different.    \\n*We remember a lot, it\\'s the retrieval process that is difficult.    \\nIn order to make retrieval easier, we rely on a few simple tools.    \\n    *Repetition, Repetition, Repetition    \\n    *Association with something - Something to jog your memory    \\n    *Extraordinary/Unique/Odd - We are good at putting things in patterns, so things that don\\'t fall in order stick out and are easy to remember.    \\nBottom line - Dreams are not repetitive, if you\\'re not a lucid dreamer then you can\\'t form associations, and most dreams are not exceptional. My trouble with dreams is:\\nEvery so often, I have dreams where I am completely immersed in that world, and more often than not the world I am coming from does not have many things in common with my waking life.  I struggle with the transition and often bolt out of bed in complete surprise to find myself in the surroundings of my normal life.

       " ('Why are Spain and Portugal under Franco and Salazar considered \"merely\" authoritarian and not fascist like Italy and Germany under Mussolini and Hitler?',\n",
       "  'Fascism doesn\\'t mean \"very authoritarian\". Rather, it\\'s a particular flavour of authoritarianism — the communist dictatorships are most definitely not fascist, as anti-communism is one of the pillars of fascism!\\n\\nFascism was, amongst other things, anti-religious (though they eventually toned that down), whereas both Portuguese and Spanish dictatorships appealed strongly to a catholic base. Fascism is anti-conservatism, while both Franco and Salazar were quite conservative.\\n\\nWhile they were both right-wing dictatorships (and, therefore, shared more similarities with Fascism than they did with communist dictatorships), they didn\\'t quite go along with all the tenets of Fascism. They became our allies against the communists after the war. Fascism becomes acceptable under those circumstances. Franco was more or less a fascist, just a heavily Catholic one. Spain had a fascist party - the Falange - and Franco merged the fascist party with the Carlist party to create his movement. The Carlist party was very conservative and actually based on the idea of \"Spain was better when ruled by a king\" and so this mixture of arch-traditionalism and fascism marked the early years of his rule. \\n\\nLike other fascists, Franco was skeptical of capitalism, but softened this after the war.  But he was an authoritarian that cared very much about a unity of the spanish people. Most other forms of fascism focused on war and imperialism, and Franco did not, but that may have been more out of weakness than anything else; Spain was in no position to expand the empire. \\n\\nSince fascism was certainly not a good thing to trumpet in 1945 Europe, Franco made efforts to distance himself from fascism. Fascism comes from the roman word Fascis which means a bundle. \\n\\nEssentially, it\\'s the ideal of a unified, strong, monoculture.  Fascism is the idea that one particular group represents an ideal, that people not belonging to that group are detrimental to that ideal, and that the most important thing is to be unified.  It believes in unquestioning acceptance of the norm and of authority so long as that authority is in the same culture.  It believes that essentially anything goes towards outsiders. Violence, war, murder is OK as long as it benefits your group.  Questioning, wavering, disobedience, free-thinking is antithetical.  Fascism is about Autarky- self-sufficient, self-reliant, strong, ignoring tradition, ignoring the weak, banding the strong with the strong, improving themselves by excising the parts they feel bring them down.\\n\\nAuthoritarianism is about who controls power.  If a government is authoritarian, they are going to be making rules unilaterally, and enforcing them strongly. This doesn\\'t mean fascist, it just means authoritarian.  On the other hand, a fascist government is necessarily authoritarian because a key concept is the unquestioning loyalty to authority. \\n\\nFascism is when you start to side with your faction regardless of the outcome, agree with your faction regardless of the truth, call those who disagree with your faction traitors, distance yourself from, hate or exile people within your faction for expressing views opposite to the prevailing thought, feel that your importance is tied to the importance of your faction, become unwilling to accept individuals from outside of your faction, willing hurt individuals outside of your faction without remorse but are unwilling to tolerate any injury to anyone within your faction without exception (though if the injured individual is found to be not worthy of being in the faction after the fact, then it\\'s OK). \\n\\nIf you start to parrot the lies that your leader says, and attack anyone who calls the leader out on their lies.  If you start to dismiss anyone who disagrees with the leader as not a \"real\" member of the faction and work to distance them from the faction, if you think that your faction is strong, and the mere presence of outsiders is weakening the faction, and that they should be removed, punished or killed.  These are the things that lead to fascism. \\n\\nAuthoritarianism is about how a government acts.  Do they make the rules themselves? Do they enforce them harshly? Are they unwilling to compromise? Do they ignore the will of the people if it doesn\\'t suit them? The easiest answer is that wiki is simply wrong. Portugal and Spain were absolutely fascist. They just adapted fascism to their own cultures and thus differed somewhat from the Italian Standard. But saying that makes them not fascist would be akin to saying Maoist China wasn\\'t communist because Mao adopted his own twist on Marxism-Leninism. \\n\\nThe harder answer is...

       "  \"Are you asking where the breathing air in a submarine comes from? \\n\\nIf that's the case there is a machine called a carbon dioxide scrubber. What it does is turn the carbon dioxide into water and a byproduct via a chemical reaction. \\n\\nBut this does not make any oxygen. There are 2 ways to get oxygen. Either you bring tanks of oxygen onto the sub, and you release oxygen when you need to. \\n\\nOr you create oxygen from the water. The process is called electrolysis. What it does is separate the hydrogen atoms from the oxygen atom. There are multiple systems on a sub that work in conjunction to maintain breathable air to the crew.  Nuclear subs have a more than ample supply of electricity, so water can be broken down into O2 and H2 via electrolysis.  The O2 is stored and dispersed into the ship, while the H2 is sent to a CO-H2 burner to eliminate both hydrogen and carbon monoxide.  CO2 scrubbers are used to remove excess CO2 from the air.  Note that the nitrogen in the air becomes a relative constant, since we don't react to it.  Note that the sub normally maintains a slightly higher O2 level than is found naturally, with the side effect of finding it hard to get to sleep the first few nights aboard\\n\\nIf needed, the sub's diesel generator can be used to ventilate, or replace the air on the ship, as it sucks it air for operation.  This can even be done while submerged when the sub is at snorkel depth.  This is an important capability in the event of a fire or other toxic gas issue, and crews drill often on this when underway\\n\\nThe ship does have extensible emergency air breathing (EAB) systems and masks for the crew.  The EAB masks have long hoses and support buddy connections so that crews can continue to do their jobs in degraded atmospheres.  The sub's air tanks can sustain the crew for very extended periods of time. To oversimplify, submarines have systems for removing CO2 and adding O2 to maintain a normal, breathable atmosphere inside.  Spacecraft are similar, though even more self contained. When the o2 generators go down they can also burn oxygen candles.\\n\\nSource: former uss seawolf submariner\"),\n",

       "  \"*dusts off pharmaceutical patent essay from last year in college*\\n\\nA patent is a legal instrument which gives you the exclusive right to manufacture and sell something for a certain length of time. In order to get filed a patent has to show 'inventiveness' (you've invented something new) and originality (it can't have been invented by someone else previously). The patent gives you a 'negative right' - you have no obligation to make or sell your product, but you can force other people to not sell it (or to charge a fee for selling it).\\n\\nSay you invent the nail clipper. Before, everybody has been biting their nails, there has been no way to cut fingernails before. You could patent:\\n\\n- 'A hinged metal cutting device [like this](_URL_0_)'.\\n- 'A hinged metal cutting device for the purpose of removing fingernails'.\\n\\nYou can patent devices and methods/processes, but not ideas. As far as I'm aware the line between a method and an idea can be very blurry.\\n\\nThere are different levels of patents. The first patent would stop anyone from manufacturing and selling nail clippers. It is the stronger of the two patents, because you have complete control over the invention. The second patent does not stop people from selling nail clippers, only from selling clippers for the purpose of clipping nails. A competitor could sell their own version of the nail clippers, but only if they said on the packet 'not for fingernails! Only use on (X)'.\\n\\nPatents usually last for 20 years or so, *from the date of filing*. This is important in medicine and pharmaceuticals because you have to patent an invention before it is submitted to the FDA for approval. Since this approval can take many years you might have only a short space of time to sell your device. After the patent has expired anybody could make your device and sell it at whatever price they like. \\n\\nThere are also jurisdictional issues: patents have to be filed separately in the US, the EU, Japan, and the rest of the world. If you have only filed a patent in the US a competitor could sell your device in the EU.\\n\\nBefore a patent is filed the invention must be kept secret, but after it's filed you must make all the details of the invention public.\"),\n",

In this case the complete garment would have two pants, or better, a pair. Pantaloon as a garment could be used in the singular, but most often the plural was preferred. \\n\\nIn the U.S. in particular, the single word \"pant\" came be used in the retail clothing industry (late 19th c. onward) to represent what every one else would call either \"pants\" or \"a pair of pants,\" e.g., \" A practical and well made pant for general sportswear\" (L.L. Bean Catalogue, 1962). \\n\\nSometimes clerks would use pant alone as a part-for-the-whole expression, meaning a garment with pantlegs. But \"pants\" as we know them really got their start as a colloquialism in the U.S. in the 19th century. There is still a widespread feeling that \"pants\" are not quite as dignified as \"trousers.\" \\n\\nI mentioned pantaloon. The word has an interesting history, which I\\'ll only touch on. It was orginally the name of a character in the Italian commedia dell\\'arte. He represented a Venetian type and spoke in Venetian dialect (as did the Zanni character), and wore close-fitting trousers down to the foot. (Most commedia characters were known not only by their name, their calling, their dialect, and their manner, but also by their costume.) \\n\\nThe French picked up on the name Pantalon (their version of Pantaleone), and passed it to the English as Pantaloon, both of which were used both for pants and for the character. Pantaloon is an old fool, whether in Italian, French or English. \\n\\nThis does not answer the question about using the plural for a singular garment. This is also the case with shorts (that is, short pants). After the term \"pants\" came to be accepted for female attire, we had also pantaloons and panties, the latter being used both in the singular and in the plural, mostly in the plural. In a panty-raid, one steals panties. If a girl on spring break accidentally drops her bikini bottom you may say, \"She dropped her panties.\" I don\\'t know if anyone would ever say, \"She lost her panty,\" but I don\\'t think so. (Panty in the singular is used mostly in trade language, like pant.) \\n\\nIn any case, it\\'s a garment with holes for the legs. This is also true of short shorts and tighty whities and briefs. But the actual covering of the legs is omitted altogether, unless you dignify the origin of the legs, or stump, as a pair of legs. When you don\\'t even get the stump, as in a thong, no one uses the plural. \\n\\nSo, one shirt, a pair of shorts, but NOT two shorts. Originally a pant was a pant-leg.'),\n",

However you can do this w/ a two syllable command.  For example teach your dog to leave a treat on the floor until you say okay.  \\n\\nThen start saying things like Oklahoma or Oh Boy.  The dog can be trained to only move on okay.  So when you expand this to \"Fido come,\" they aren\\'t learning \"the name,\" they are learning the multiple syllables that apply to them as they don\\'t understand them as \"words,\" either.  \\n\\nWhich you can further break down just using random sounds.

Those movies where they open it up and grope around the innards? Don\\'t fucking do that, ever. Even if you opened it up safely, you might see a bunch of wires and some microchips. You have no fucking clue what any of it does. Which one is the timer? who knows.\\n* let\\'s say you found the timer. Time to disconnect? Well, maybe the timer is designed to provide a constant signal as long as it\\'s ticking, and the bomb explodes when the signal stops? disconnecting the timer would cause the bomb to explode. Well.. shit.\\n\\nReal world bomb disposal techniques are a trade secret of the bomb squads, but the general rules are 1) stay the *fuck* away from the bomb 2) send in an RCV to x-ray the fucker. 3) set up containment shielding if possible 4) try to get the bomb away, or, if not possible 5) disarm it on the spot.\\n\\nthe actual \"disarm it on the spot\" stuff varies wildly from bomb to bomb (hence why you want to find out as much as possible about the bomb beforehand).

       " ('How did early civilizations introduced money into their barter driven society?',\n",
       "  'As a side note, most anthropologists now reject the idea of a barter driven economy. Instead, most believe that pre-monetary economies were likely gift economies, with barter reserved for trading with outsiders, who perhaps couldn\\'t be relied on to give a gift in turn. \\n\\nAs such, commodity money likely emerge as whatever good was universally enough desired, to be a good medium for exchange. You don\\'t need this to be enforced from the top down. The need for some form of currency likely increased as humans settled into larger and larger groups, getting to the point where a gift economy was no longer feasible. Commodity money could be used, just because everyone wanted the commodity it was made of, and could rely on being able to exchange it again for goods or services they needed. Once you\\'ve got enough people working specialized professions and trading things, money arises pretty quickly after that, just out of convenience. It doesn\\'t have to be imposed from the top down.\\n\\nHere\\'s an example of how it could happen: I makes pottery for a living, but the government wants its tax in the form of grain. So I find a farmer and trade them pottery for grain, then give the grain to the local tax collector. But that\\'s a pain in the butt for me, because I have to go buy and ship and store all this grain even tho I don\\'t need it. So instead, I give the tax collector a tablet engraved with the words \"this rock is worth a dozen urns or the equivalent amount of grain, signed, TheKolaBoarhole.\" They take that to the farmer and trade it to him for the grain they need. He accepts the tablet because he knows who I am and trusts me, and then at some convenient point he gives the rock back to me in exchange for urns. Or, if he doesn\\'t need urns, he trades the tablet to the local candlemaker in exchange for candles.\\n\\nI use tax as an example, but you can imagine that in any community of specialized craftspeople and merchants, they\\'ll be trading with each other very frequently. They\\'ll soon start keeping accounts and \"tabs\" with each other that get settled on a regular basis, just because it\\'s easier for both sides than constantly swapping physical goods if you don\\'t need them right away. And then you\\'ll see people doing three-way transactions, like \"I\\'ll settle my debt with you by paying off your debt with him, because you don\\'t need my urns but he does.\" So pretty soon you\\'re trading shiny stones or pieces of paper that are worth a mutually agreed-upon amount of urns and pottery and candles, and you just invented money. Pretty soon your shiny stones will be invested with civilizational pride and cultural value, and you\\'ll give them a special name and the king will put his face on them, but that\\'s just the last formal step.\\n\\nSource: I\\'m an economist, and I\\'ve read about the proto-currency engraved tablets they\\'ve found in Sumerian ruins, predating even the Egyptian civilization. >  Imagine you have a group of people who solely trade their goods (meat, vegetables, etc) through barter. \\n\\nThis probably never happened.  Before commodity money, trade was based more on debt than on barter.\\n\\n >  Somewhere down the line, a decision is made to manufacture tokens by an authoritative entity (e.g. government) and everyone somehow agrees to a token\\'s value,\\n\\nThis didn\\'t happen, so there is no explanation for how things which didn\\'t happen happened.

Since it is one of the busiest, most traffic infested freeways in the country, the news stations hyped it up that because of its closing, there would be tremendous amounts of traffic spilling onto the other freeways (the 5, 605, 110, etc.) The news stations even claimed traffic would be backed up to the Mexican border. Basically it would be the end of the world as we know it (you know, with explosions and stuff). Then the day came when they shut down the freeway for construction. And nothing happened. Nobody went out, because City officials urged people to stay off the freeway, ride bikes, use public transportation or simply just stay inside. And everybody did. Due to the people simply cooperating, there was no \"Carmageddon\" as the media hyped. Instead the news stations looked silly and tried to find other stories about how the people were affected by the dust/mess or noise of the construction. But the construction was very speedy and efficient, and at no risk to residents, as the workers finished ten hours ahead of their deadline. Major freeway in Los Angeles (connecting road systems of northern and southern LA) was closed for a weekend while they demolished an overpass. Celebrities made an announcements on Twitter and radio urging people to stay at home. People paid attention, the crew worked around the clock and finished almost ten hours early, and catastrophe was avoided There was also a computer game where the aim was to run people over.

There have been many such attacks with varying degrees of success but so far no one has taken the entire DNS down for any meaningful amount of time. A fellow by the name of Dan Kaminsky uncovered a (if exploited) fatal security exploit in 2008 but luckily for everyone he chose to notify the authorities instead of use the exploit for malicious purposes. For his efforts he was given one of the 14 \"keys\" to the DNS system. In the event of a failure 7 of the 14 keyholders must meet at a secret pre-determined place in order to reboot the DNS.\\n\\nThe technique Dan Kaminsky discovered exploited a flaw in the way DNS servers decide which servers they can trust and which ones they can\\'t. Basically he found he could trick a DNS server into believing that he was also a \"trustable\" DNS server and that domain name lookup tables he provided were therefore also legit. Of course if you can feed incorrect information to DNS server which it will blindly accept you can destroy its lookup tables in what is known as cache poisoning. If those tables become corrupted the server becomes effectively useless at providing correct information and its tables will need to be rebuilt.\\n\\nOther methods such as DDoS are much more crude and work by simply overwhelming the system with bogus requests so that it doesn\\'t have time to respond to legitimate requests, effectively grinding everything to a halt. These kinds of attacks are usually limited to smaller parts of the DNS because they simply don;t have the \"firepower\\' to be able to knock out the whole thing. Additionally, the DNS is designed in such a way that the attack would have to completely saturate the system for more that 24 hours before it could actually start to mess things up. Usually in that amount of time you can either deploy some counter measures or find other ways to filter out the malicious traffic.\\n\\nRecently efforts have been made to make the DNS much more distributed and therefore much harder to completely take offline.

It very quickly reaches a point where you *have* to keep using meth, because you can never really feel happy without it. Think of crystal meth as if cookies were illegal. People live their daily lives eating sandwiches and pasta etc. But one evening, you are offered a thick, chocolate chipped cookie by a buddy. The first time you bite into it, you have an explosion of happiness in your mouth. And for the next few hours, you feel as if warm chocolate is constantly being smeared onto your palate. You feel truly happy with this meal. Then, you go back to your normal day, and have a turkey sandwich for lunch, but it pales into comparison with that scrumptious cookie your friend gave you. You go back to you friend, and get another cookie to have another night of joy. After a few weeks of this trend, you are having trouble finding anything that can make you happy, unless it starts with C and ends with ookie. Your daily lunch sandwich taste like chalk. You even try going to your favorite steak place, and it is now bland and not worth the money (might as well have just gotten 3 cookies). You are unable to become happy. Your life is losing meaning, and you realize you are an addict. Think of happiness like light. Everyday things are like candles and camera flashes. And that\\'s good. Now meth, meth is like looking into the sun. If you look at the sun too long, you have trouble seeing other light. Even things you could see clearly before, like the camera flash, you can\\'t anymore. But that\\'s OK because you\\'re looking into the sun, right? Wrong. The sun is the brightest thing you can see. Too bright. Your eyes can\\'t handle it. Eventually you start to go blind. You can\\'t see the sun\\'s light as much anymore so you keep looking. And looking. Nothing else matters because that brightness was so intense, nothing else can come close.\\n\\nWhy would you want to go back to a world of camera flashes and candles when you\\'ve known the sun? That\\'s why it\\'s so addictive. Crystal Meth is a stimulant in the amphetamine class of drugs. So it is similar to some other drugs like d-amphetamine (speed). Once you use the drug, it finds its way all through your body and because the molecule is lipophilic it passes through the blood brain barrier very easily. In other words, crystal meth has a molecule that \"likes\" to interact with fat-like things. If you know any chemistry, you know that water and oil (lipids, fat) don\\'t mix very well. So you can think of molecules being either \"water loving\" or \"fat loving\", which means they mix well with one or the other, but usually not both. There are molecules that can mix with both, and that\\'s what a soap or detergent is. Anyway, meth is \"fat loving\" which makes it go easily into the brain, even though your brain has something called a blood brain barrier, which is like a protective layer that doesn\\'t let things go into the brain very easily. \\n\\nOnce the meth is in the brain it does something very similar to other stimulants, it make it so that a bunch of the neurons (brain cells) that have this chemical called \"dopamine\", release this chemical into your brain, along with some other chemicals (serotonin and norepinephrine). These chemicals in the brain is what causes the high. Dopamine is the chemical in your brain that makes you feel good. So when you eat your favorite meal, your brain releases dopamine to make you happy that you ate the meal. But this works for things like getting a good grade on a test, which makes you feel happy and well about the test. This dopamine chemical is also important for your brain to remember what things make you feel good. So your brain will make a memory that when you got a good grade on a test you felt good, and it will try to get your body to do that again. \\n\\nNow imagine someone taking meth, their brain becomes flooded with this chemical. It is released much more than when you get a good grade. So much that your brain starts to run out of, and when it does, that\\'s when you crash. Then the brain works really fast to make more of it, and store it for the future.\\n\\nNow about addiction. When someone decides to do meth for the first time, they want to do it usually because they think that it will make them feel really good and happy. So the first time they do it, they enjoy it a lot. Well, once you have done it, you may want to do it again, because you remember how good it felt. So you go ahead and use meth again. Except that the more you use meth, the more your brain gets this \"flood\" of dopamine (the chemical from before). However, the brain isn\\'t supposed to have this happen, a normal brain never has that much dopamine around. So the brain starts to \"think\": \\n\\nJeez, there is something weird going on here, all this dopamine is not normal, but if this is going to happen all the time I need to do something about it.\\n\\nSo what happens is, the brain will start \"telling\" the brain cells that this flood is going to happen again. So in order to help the brain stay \"normal\" (normal being not make you feel super great, which is weird for the brain) it tells all your brain cells to respond less to the dopamine. It\\'s a bit like inflation in the economy, if things cost more money, workers need to get paid more, but then their employer needs to make more money too, so they increase the price of what they sell. Because the brain is trying to avoid this dopamine flood from making it all weird again, it increases how much dopamine you need to feel the effects. Not only that, but it makes it so that the brain is not making as much dopamine either, so when the person isn\\'t using meth, they have less dopamine in their brain than a normal person that doesn\\'t use meth. This is what makes the addict feel depressed and sad when they are not using meth. \\n\\nThat\\'s why it\\'s not a good idea to mess around with your brain like that. Explain like I\\'m 5 huh?\\n\\n*Well, I\\'ll try.*\\n\\n\\n**Me:** \"You know when you\\'re sad and you want to feel happy?\"\\n\\n**5:** Yes\\n\\n**Me:** Or when you\\'re really tired and want to go to sleep but can\\'t because you have something to do?\\n\\n**5:** Yes\\n\\n**Me:** Well what meth does, is it wakes you up... so much that people who take it get really excited... so much they can\\'t think straight and they jump around doing one thing then another without stopping for hours. \\n\\n**5:** Oh... \\n\\n**Me:** but the really bad part is when,  \"Remember when I told you you never get something for nothing?\"  \\n\\n**5:** yeah...

Imagine all of your inhibitions are gone, little old you is capable of anything. In small doses it\\'s a kick ass drug but it\\'s easy to keep going and going and before you know it it\\'s been 4 days. \\n\\nIt\\'s addicting because you feel sooooo good that the moment you come down (and it\\'s sudden) you\\'re like, \"fuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuck!\" The biggest problem though is that for hours / days (depending on how long you\\'ve been binging) after you come down you can\\'t go to sleep and it\\'s not a fun burst of energy it\\'s an emotionally draining and depressing time which makes you want to get more, even though in a little bit you\\'ll feel fine it\\'s so shitty you justify getting more. Maybe we should wait until he is older to explain meth....what do you think honey? I recommend the National Geographic documentary on Netflix Instant called, \"The World\\'s Most Dangerous Drug (Meth).\" It\\'s pretty good and really gives somewhat of an impression of what it does to the body. My favorite quote from it is \"if you can make chocolate chip cookies, then you can make meth\" Really interesting! The scariest thing I\\'ve ever heard about meth is that the first time you do it, it\\'s the best feeling in the world, and each subsequent use is a little less fulfilling. But you keep trying, hoping to reach that ultimate feeling. People say addicting a lot. Which is correct, addicting or addictive?'),\n",

       "  'Aspirin (Bayer, Bufferin) - Treats aches and can reduce inflammation. Can be rough on GI tract, is an anticoagulant (bad for hemophiliacs), and not always safe for kids.\\n\\nIbuprofen (Advil, Motrin) - Similar to aspirin, but different chemicals and less GI irritation.\\n\\nNaproxen (Aleve) - Anti-inflammatory, also has longer half life, so it lasts longer\\n\\nAcetaminophen (Tylenol) - Pain reliever, NOT and anti-inflammatory. Easy on the GI tract, safe for hemophiliacs and children. Some doctors consider it to be dangerous, since the pain relief dose and overdose are close.\\n\\nNon-Aspirin is anything that doesn\\'t have aspirin in it.\\n\\nPersonally, my dad\\'s friend died from an aspirin OD, so I\\'ve never taken it. Acetaminophen doesn\\'t do anything for me, so ibuprofen and naproxen are my go-tos.\\n\\nHope that helps. In my experience, aspirin is used rarely as an analgesic in clinical settings because of the GI side effects. On a personal level, I find it very effective for headaches in conjunction with caffeine  &  acetominophen. It has anti-inflammatory effects that make it useful for musculoskeletal pain as well as headaches. \\n\\n\\nAspirin\\'s antiplatelet effects are the reason it\\'s used to prevent strokes  &  heart attacks (and as a treatment for heart attacks while people await catheterization/thrombolytics). Aspirin is the only OTC drug I know of that irreversibly inhibits platelets - ie your platelets dont recover, you simply make new ones over time that work better after you stop taking it. These effects also make it dangerous - your body has a much more difficult time stopping bleeding. For people who fall and hit their head (or are assaulted or in a MVC, etc) while on aspirin an intracranial bleed is a much greater risk. \\n\\n\\nAspirin is highly acidic and massively toxic in overdose, though we tend to think of acetominophen as being the classic OTC overdose drug. It\\'s processed by your kidneys and should probably be avoided by people with kidney problems. \\n\\n\\nIbuprofen (motrin) naprosyn (aleve) celecoxib (celebrex)  &  ketorolac (toradol) are all non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs that all work similarly to aspirin with regards to analgesia. There are some minor differences in how they work  &  are processed by your body. The biggest difference is that they inhibit platelets reversibly - your existing platelets begin to work better when you stop taking the drug. They have varying degrees of GI effects and people swear by a specific drug on the list. I like ibuprofen personally, but many people swear by aleve because of the more convenient twice daily dosing. \\n \\n\\nAcetominophen (tylenol, paracetamol) works in a different way entirely. Instead of treating the cause of much of the pain we feel (inflammation), it treats the signal. It doesn\\'t have any antiplatelet function. In large doses it\\'s toxic to the liver, though unlike aspirin the signs of overdose are often not apparent until you\\'re totally fucked. Acetominophen has more antipyretic (working against fever) activity than the NSAIDs. If your headache is from a cold/flu, tylenol is your best friend. I find tylenol less effective for musculoskeletal pain, but using it in conjunction with ibuprofen can help you steadily maintain a lower pain level. Certified Pharmacy Tech here....\\n\\nIbuprofen (Motrin), Naproxen (Aleve), Aspirin (Bayer) are all Non steroidal anti-inflammitories (NSAIDS).  They focus on treating inflammation but have the down side of being harder on the stomach and aspirin specifically acts as a blood thinner, hence its use during heart attacks.  \\n\\nAcetaminophen (Tylenol) is a general pain reliever which is in a separate class from anything out there.  \\n\\nA few other notes on your local store\\'s pain section... \\n\\nExcedrin is usually a combination of NSAIDS and Acetaminophen along with caffeine and if you look at the ingredients despite there being 6 or so types of Excedrin 4 of them are exactly the same.  \\n\\nAlso, any of those PM versions of medications don\\'t have any actual \"sleep\" medicine in them.  They all have diphenhydramine in them which is simply benadryl.  Benadryl is used for a lot of things including allergies and sleep. I think this episode of [SciShow](_URL_0_) may help you.'),\n",

       "  \"I'm a pilot, not an aeronautical engineer, but I can tell you that flight like that isn't something you can sustain for very long.\\n\\nWe are taught to think of vectors when taking turns. The airplane will generate more lift by flying straight and level and upright--so think of an arrow pointing upward from the floor of the airplane representing its direction of lift. You can do things to make it longer, to generate more lift. You can use speed and deflection and adjust the wing chord.\\n\\nAs you turn, you will always lose lift and the vertical component drops. So, we increase our angle of attack to maintain altitude. At a 30 degree bank, we have to pull bank as well as maintain the turn to keep level. At 60 degrees bank, you feel close to or around 2G's continuously. As you near 90 degrees bank, the airplane would not physically or mathematically be able to increase its lift enough to fly perfectly level.\\n\\nIt is possible to use yaw to hold onto some lift, but even that wears off.\\n\\nIt is possible to appear level and complete a major arc at 90 degrees, losing only a small amount of altitude, but it requires significant speed. The gravity vector pulls only so much, and so long as the bank doesn't exceed 90 degrees, the aircraft can use maximum lift and maximum G's to render the gravity vector negligible for the purpose of a 5 second maneuver. No physical way to hold it much longer unless you have jet engines and a structurally powerful aircraft and a G suit. _URL_0_\\n\\nyou mean like that right?\\n\\nThere's a few reasons, first off the story that you've been taught about the curved wings of a plane providing lift isn't entirely true.\\n\\nIf that was true how would a plane fly upside down?\\n\\n_URL_1_\\n\\nAn important part of a plane's ability to fly has to do with deflection, At high speed the plane wants to move through the air as easily as possible. And because going up or down or sideways is a lot harder because more surface area of the plane's gonna be pushing against the air, which at those speeds behaves a little more like a liquid.\\n\\nIf you want to experience this for yourself, stick your hand out of a moving car.

There are so many other factors at work, such as hydraulic shock, shattered bone that\\'s been displaced by the entry, the exit wound, which can be several times the size of the entrance wound, severed arteries or damage to critical organs such as the liver, lungs, stomach and heart. Sometimes this means removing a section of intestine, relieving pressure in the chest from internal bleeding/lung suction to drain fluids etc, and all are a bigger worry than a 9mm slug that will sit lodged in muscle for a while, until the body grows around it and/or develops an infection, in which case secondary operation will be required. \\n\\nthirdly, depending on the caliber of the firearm; a 9mm parabellum will pass straight through most points from under 15 meters IIRC, a .45 ACP will ALMOST run out of energy, a .357 magnum will go straight through, leaving no bullet to remove, and most rifle cartridges from the same range, it\\'s often hydraulic shock that kills first. \\n\\nI actually asked a surgeon about it a while ago and whilst he said he\\'d been lucky enough in 20 years to not have to attend to a GSW, he had heard, learned/read (was high as a kite on morphine at the time) that stopping the bleeding and restoring the bodies processes are primary, removing the projectile is secondary. Oftentimes they\\'ll operate to stabilise, then operate a second time to remove if necessary. \\n\\ntl;dr: forget bullets, air goes in and out, blood goes round and round, any variation on these must be attended to. Speaking from personal experience, I took a .32 to the chest during an armed robbery. First thing that happened is I was rolled in (I was on a stretcher, obviously) to a room in the ER. There they did an ultrasound to trace the path of the bullet through me. Once they found out that I had been struck in some pretty serious spots (bounced off a rib, left bone fragments in my heart and lungs, punctured my diaphragm, and punctured my stomach twice before stopping against my back) they had to check for internal bleeding. This is when things get fun. They also didn\\'t have my medical history, so no pain killers were being administered. Had to do this part cold turkey. I\\'m sure there are plenty of ways to check for internal bleeding, but, I guess in this case, the fastest and most effective way was to ram a pair of tongs with some cotton on the end up my ass. If I wasn\\'t bleeding internally before, I damn sure was after. That\\'s when the doctor informed me I was going to need surgery. And then they put a Foley catheter into my penis. Again, no pain killers. That, to this day, remains to be the single most painful experience of my life. I literally have nightmares about those ten seconds even today, and this took place in 2004. Finally they gave me some Morphine and rolled my stretcher to an operating suite. The last thing I remember is the anesthesiologist putting a mask on me, and telling me I was going to feel a little warm. I started to get warm. I woke up three days later. I had a scar running from my sternum to just below my belly button, they had opened me up for \"exploratory surgery\". Removing bone fragments and the like. The bullet was removed from my back. A chest tube was inserted into my left armpit. Interestingly enough, I don\\'t remember getting that or having it removed. I\\'m told that\\'s for the better. So, anyway, that, in a nut shell, is what happens in the hospital when you get shot. I don\\'t recommend it. Being shot isn\\'t a single thing and happens the same way every time.  You could be shot in the lung, or the liver, or the brain, or just some muscle or fat.   Bones could be broken.  Nerves could be damaged.  The bullet may have splintered.  It may be a through and through.\\n\\nQuite often though bullets are left in.  They\\'re more worried about stopping bleeding and the like to go digging around to find the bullet. Typically the hospital will get advanced notification that a trauma is arriving, so the appropriate people will be in the trauma bay ready to receive the patient as soon as they arrive.\\n\\nIn the trauma bay, there is a standardized trauma protocol, and it can be pretty detailed, down to the point of denoting who stands where (e.g. trauma surgery to the right of chest, resident on left side.  ED doctor at head of bed.  ED nurse at right leg, etc).  Everyone has jobs to do and multiple things will happen at once, with people shouting out what they\\'re doing and what\\'s going on.  In high volume centers, this is more organized, in lower volume centers it can be more chaotic.\\n\\nThe goal here is to stabilize, identify injuries and then prepare for the next step, so depending on the degree of injury, patients will be getting IV fluid, often blood transfusions or a breathing tube.  They\\'ll also get a chest tube if needed at this time (if the lung was shot).\\n\\nOnce they\\'re stabilized to some degree, then they can go to the operating room.  With arms and legs surgery involves exploring the area, mostly to control bleeding.  The bullet (if present) is taken out and then they\\'re closed back up.  \\n\\nIf it\\'s in the abdomen, then an exploratory laparotomy is performed, where the belly is opened and all the contents checked for injury.  Injured structures are either repaired or removed (depending on viability).  Depending on severity of injury, the belly may be left open (e.g. skin not sewn back together).\\n\\nIf it\\'s in the chest (and they survived), they\\'ll already have a chest tube from the trauma bay.\\n\\nIf the bullet goes in the skull (and they survived), they\\'ll get a craniotomy, which allows the neurosurgeon to decompress the brain and address any bleeding.  The brain isn\\'t explored and the bullet is typically left in place.\\n\\nThe goals of all these surgery is to control bleeding and repair damage, not to take the bullet out, but bullets that are seen are typically removed.\\n\\n(This is how things work in a Trauma center in the US, it\\'s probably different in other environments). Likely to be a huge follow up with the PD about how/when etc. I was on a ride-along with the local police department one night and there was a shooting between two local gangs and a dude got it to the chest and my cop and I were posted at the hospital to collect evidence. I will preface this by saying that no two gun shot wounds are the same. This particular guy was shot by a 9mm through a car window so there was some deflection and loss of energy from that, but the entry wound was middle of his right pectoral with no exit. They found the bullet with a CT scan in his lower back just under the subcutaneous fat layer. I asked the pathologist what was going to happen to him and he told me, \"Well, he\\'s got a punctured lung and a couple broken ribs but he\\'ll be fine eventually.\"  We kept talking and he basically explained that if they don\\'t have to remove the bullet they\\'re not going to, although, because this one was so close to the skin, they probably will at some time in the future. The pathologist said he was amazed that I didn\\'t pass-out in the ER from the blood which I thought was funny because it\\'s just blood, granted it was a couple pints on the floor, but it was just blood. I work in the Emergency Department and we\\'ve had a few GSW (gun shot wound) patients roll in. Treatment for the pt varies, depending on the location of the GSW and clinical condition of the patient.\\n\\nFor example, we\\'ve had a patient with 3 GSW to his chest. He had to be intubated and a chest tube was placed because his lung had collapsed. He was then transferred by a helicopter to a trauma unit. \\n\\nAnother patient was shot in the hand. In this case, a plastic surgeon was called to do the repair. \\n\\nThe bullet is usually never taken out by the ED physician. A surgeon will take the patient to the OR and remove the bullet themselves. In the ED, the physician will do their best to stabilize the patient (IV fluids, blood transfusions if neccessary, CT/XR/lab work) and the patient will then be transferred to the care of the physician. Also, the wound is not repaired. Again, that is the job of the surgeon/specialist. The ED physician will only try to stop or reduce the bleeding. Surgical sub-specialist:  we don\\'t care about the bullet.  We stabilize/fix you as best we can (sew up bleeding vessels, drain blood/air  from places it shouldn\\'t be(lungs/pericardium), give you blood products, stabilize/fix broken bones, etc).

       " ('How is the United States able to rack up US$16 trillion of public debt?',\n",
       "  'When the US federal government needs to pay more for things than it collects in taxes, it sells \"Treasury Bonds\" which pay a set (but usually small) amount of interest. Treasury Bonds are low return but from a country like the US they are as close as the world gets to no risk. The US has never missed a payment since 1775, and there is no reason to think it will stop any time soon. So by buying these bonds you trade high return for high security. \\n\\nThe rate of return (how much money is payed to bond holders) is set by a combination of the Federal Reserve\\'s interest rate as well as the demand for bonds. The lower the interest rate the less the debt \"costs.\" Right now a 5 year bond has a .8% interest, then if you buy $5,000 worth of bonds you will receive .8% interest at the end of five years on your $5,000. The payments are on a fixed schedule so people can\\'t just suddenly \"demand their money early.\"\\n\\nMost bonds are bought by Americans or American institutions like banks. In 2008 as the height of the collapse (for example) there wasn\\'t even enough bonds to go around because security was valued so highly at the time, so they could be offered at near zero (.001%) return and banks would still buy them because it decreased the risk they had. Of the current $15 (not 16) trillion, about $11 trillion are owned by Americans or American institutions. So while we owe China money, they aren\\'t the ones who own most of the debt.\\n\\nThe debt is in a never ending state of being re-payed and then re-borrowed. Alexander Hamilton wanted there to be a US debt because it both establishes a base interest rate, allows credit to flow between banks easily and a few other technical things. Andrew Jackson was the one and only president to pay off the debt in full, and when he did and there were no more bonds the credit and banking system of the country froze up. It caused a financial \"panic\" and a minor recession. Jackson then started borrowing again and as a result credit began to flow more easily. \\n\\nBut it is possible to pay the debt back, though not advisable to pay it all back until there is no debt at all. Following World War II we had (adjusted for inflation) roughly double the debt we have today. Then in the rest of the 40s and into the 50s the government kept taxes high to pay back all those people who bought bonds. The debt kept going down until the 1970s when the economy slowed down, but by then we had reduced the debt to pre-Great Depression levels. \\n\\nThe reason why the debt is so big is quite simple: low taxes. Reagan\\'s tax cuts lead to him tripping the debt in eight years. Clinton raised taxes and eventually got a surplus. Then the second Bush cut taxes to below Reagan\\'s level and Obama has cut them further than that. Bad economies always lead to more debt, but the reason why its *so* bad is the low taxes. We have the single lowest tax rate in the first world, and that\\'s not from some liberal think tank, that\\'s the CIA\\'s own numbers. If we ever want to pay back the debt we need to raise taxes, and not just on the rich, everyone needs to pay more taxes. \\n\\nTL;DR: The money is owed to many people and institutions, but most of them are American. People do claim the money they are owed because payments are made at a regular schedule like paying off any other kind of debt. The debt increased from $1 trillion in 1980 to $15 trillion now mostly due to low taxes, but the explosion since 2008 has been due more so to a bad economy than anything else. It is possible to pay back all the debt, but *some* national debt is good for the economy because it creates bonds which are the safest form of investment. World War II lead to double the debt we have now, and we paid most of that off easily with a good post-war economy and high taxes. > Who is the money owed to?\\n\\nAnyone who buys a US Treasury Bond. Your grandmother could go buy one but the big buyers are large banks and foreign governments. China has trillions of dollars of US debt.\\n\\n >  Why is nobody claiming back the money owed to them?\\n\\nThey do. Treasury bonds have a maturity date when they come due. The government pays those people off. Where do they get the money for that? You guessed it! By racking up more debt. A decent fraction of the budget every year is servicing our debt, which basically means paying the people who cash in their bonds.\\n\\n >  How did anyone allow the debt to spiral to such an incredible amount?\\n\\nThings cost money but no one wants to pay taxes to pay for them.\\n\\n > Is it ever possible for the US to pay back all their debt?\\n\\nGood question. National Debt is not a bad thing. It is a good thing. If a nation can borrow money now to cover the cost of ten years of highway building for highways that will last 100  years, it would be foolish for it to not consider doing that. \\n\\nOK, now they are motivated what next? Well you have to make sure you can make payments on the interest. The interest is the *profit* for the people making the loan. They want to invest their money in order to make a profit, so in order to get the loan, the government needs to be able to pay back the interest.\\n\\nNow keep in mind, the government is borrowing much of this money for long term benefits that far exceed the time it takes to create them, but also these investments make it possible for the government to make even more money in the future .\\n\\nBeing able to make more money is important, because if you are making more money you can afford to pay out more interest. If you can afford to pay out more interest, then you can afford to borrow more money. When you borrow more money you create more debt. \\n\\nSo creating more and more debt is not a problem until you reach a tipping point where you are not going to end up with the income to pay off the interest. Is too much debt bad? Absolutely, but zero debt is a waste of the government. The trick is to find the balance between managing the debt and growing the economy.'),\n",

       "  'I have a degree in food science and this was a very interesting topic to me. I\\'ll try to answer to the best of my ability while keeping it simple. \\n\\nThe first reason relates to how you actually taste things. The way we perceive taste is actually a combination of our taste buds and our nose working. Taste buds send a signal to the brain when food touches them. But your nose is also very important. You have probably experienced the decrease in taste perception when you have a cold or stuffy nose. There is a passageway in the back of your throat called the retronasal route that leads into your nose. So when the food hits this spot, you essentially \"smell\" it from inside your mouth, and this adds another layer to flavor perception.\\n\\nDifferent food flavors volatilize, or become airborne (smellable) at different temperature. You will notice this when you cook. As you pull the ingredients out of the fridge they might have some odor to them, but once they are all in a pot together cooking the smell is amplified and starts to fill the whole house. In the same way, you will essentially \"smell\" hotter food through the retronasal route in your throat more than colder food, because the flavors are more airbourne. \\n\\nThere is also an interesting link between temperature and taste. In studies, people tend to perceive spicy foods as less spicy when they are cold. If you keep your hot sauce in the fridge, you will notice this. This is probably due to the reasons I explained above.'),\n",

       " ('How can a side affects of antidepressants be thoughts of suicide?',\n",
       "  'The side effect isn\\'t as direct as your post title makes it seem.\\n\\nRather it goes like this:\\n\\nA heavily depressed person has suicidal thoughts/tendencies, however the depression is so deep that it negates the will/drive to do anything, including committing suicide.\\n\\nOn starting the therapy, the therapist realizes that any treatment will fail due to the absolute lack of drive and deep seated melancholia. He prescribes antidepressants. They work as intended and increase the depressive persons activity level, thus making them theoretically \"fit\" for treatment. However in doing so, the pharmaceuticals also increased the likelihood of suicide as the treated person now has enough drive/motivation to act, including potentially acting on their suicidal tendencies.\\n\\nTL:DR\\nSometimes the only thing keeping a depressed person from committing suicide, is their total lack of drive to act. Antidepressants may work just well enough to up the drive but not well enough to remove the suicidal tendencies. We don\\'t even know \"how\" most antidepressants work. \"How\" is less relevant than the fact they do work, some of the time, for some people.\\n\\nHow it can, apparently, have an opposite effect is not entirely clear. \\n\\nOne theory is that the drugs make the person more alert and more active, more able to act on their motivatons, making it easier to follow through on existing suicidal ideation. Another idea is that their brain chemistry, and their mood,  is changing in ways they are not used to,  and this up and down effect can push someone to extreme ends of the spectrum.\\n\\nHere\\'s some more information: _URL_0_ Time to get an explanation from someone on antidepressants! This should be fun.\\n\\nLet\\'s visualize my brain as a person.\\nMy skull is a control room, got some lights flashing, control panels beep boop boop all that shit.\\n My brain is the only worker, and he\\'s slumped over against the big red \"SELF DESTRUCT\" button. \\n\\nNow, to actually complete the self destruction he\\'d have to lift himself off the button, but he can\\'t do that; He\\'s passed out from overworking. The antidepressants are the bomb squad crew members that come in to make sure everything DOESN\\'T go to shit. \\nBut, they\\'re pretty bad at their job, and kinda just lift my brain off the button and proceed to panic. \\n\\nAs a result, I have the energy to actually go kill myself, and the will to go kill myself.\\n\\nThis can be remedied by having a more members come in, or by having a different squad come in to make sure everything doesn\\'t blow up. An incredibly complex question that modern science cannot answer. \\n\\nWe can\\'t answer it for two very important reasons: \\n\\n1.  We do not understand fully the neurological mechanisms by which antidepressants (SSRIs  &  others) act, and \\n\\n2.  We do not fully understand all of the neurological causes behind suicidal thoughts and behaviors, nor can we say that all suicidal thoughts are created equal or stem from the same source. \\n\\nLike /u/monkiesnacks mentioned, paradoxical reactions can account for some of it - for every drug that does X in 95% of people, 5% of people will have Y, the *exact opposite* reaction.  \\n\\nThe problem is, we don\\'t fully understand how the brain and cognition works, and how our own neurotransmitters and hormones affect this process, and we don\\'t fully understand how the pharmaceuticals we\\'re introducing factor into that. \\n\\nConsider this huge, gaping flaw - to be prescribed SSRIs, you go to a therapist, who diagnose your mental state, and prescribe you the drug. \\n\\nSSRIs inhibit reuptake of serotonin.  Now for a lot of people, that seems to make them happier / less depressed.  Which leads us to believe, ok, obviously serotonin, and serotonin reuptake, has a large role in depression and anxiety. \\n\\nBut does ALL clinical depression and anxiety stem from Serotonin reuptake?  We don\\'t know.  What if that depressed person who went to the therapist has some sort of atypical manifestation that on the surface acts just like depression, but neurologically *has absolutely nothing to do with standard neurological causes of depression?* \\n\\nIt isn\\'t like they do scientific tests to confirm some sort of deficiency before prescribing the drugs - they basically throw drugs at a patient until something sticks, leaning on the balance of probability.  This drug works for *most* people, so it will *most likely* work for you. \\n\\nSo if you have some sort of quirky neurological cause for your depression, not only may taking SSRIs *NOT* help you, it may actually *exacerbate* your condition, because now you\\'re upsetting a neurochemical balance even further *in the wrong direction*.  Perhaps your Serotonin levels had some intricate relationship to the real cause of your depression, and you needed LESS serotonin, not MORE.  By prescribing SSRIs, and increasing your extracellular concentration of serotonin, you may in fact throw your neuro-chemical imbalance into overdrive, rapidly accelerating the process. \\n\\nThis, alas, is the great difficulty with pharmacology.  When a drug works *for most people*, it usually goes to market without its mechanisms of action being fully understood.  \\n\\nTo REALLY study a drug, you should give it to a few thousand people, some with one condition, others with no condition, and study those people *for their entire lives*, accumulating data about their hormone levels, moods, life outcomes, causes of death, and then autopsy them after death for good measure to see if the drug made any significant changes. \\n\\nInstead, they usually give it to a few hundred people for six months or a year, find out it works, and then go to market. I think something that can be confusing is the naming of these drugs. We call these drugs \"**anti**-depressants\", there are other like \"**anti**-psychotics\". These names are misleading because it implies that the drugs have a specific mechanistic effect against the symptoms. This is like giving alcohol to someone who has social anxiety and because it makes them less inhibited and more confident we then call it \"**anti**- social anxiety\" medicine.\\n\\nOf course most people intuitively understand that alcohol is not correcting something in the brain of people with social anxiety. It is simply changing their mental state in a way that masks the original symptoms. It would be silly to think that these people have an alcohol deficiency. \\n\\nAnti-depressant drugs are not really known to have a specific effect against some underlying cause of depression. They are simply changing a persons mental state just as other drugs do. Once we start thinking of the drugs in this way then we can start to understand how they might have unexpected effects. For example, 70-80% of people who take SSRI antidepressants experience some form of sexual dysfunction. This is because the drugs disrupt normal serotonin function in the brain, and serotonin is important for sexual function.  \\n\\nOne of the negative side effects that some people can experience is called akathisia. This term is a little broad but it essentially means that people can become extremely restless almost like they are having a \"depression attack\" which is similar to a panic attack only instead of anxiety building up it is depression and feelings of despair and hopelessness. This can be extremely disturbing and make people feel like the only way out is to harm themselves. This may be the reason why in large trials there are more suicidal events in the drug group than placebo, because some people experience this side effect. It also explains many of the anecdotes of people who were prescribed SSRIs for off-label conditions such as sleep, who had no history of depression, and they subsequently went on to commit suicide very suddenly after taking the drugs. \\n\\nI should point out that this is not a mainstream view. Most doctors and psychiatrists will tell you that the reason why people commit suicide is because the drug is helping them and giving them more energy. However there is no evidence to back this up and it doesn\\'t explain suicides of those without mental illness. In my view it is much more likely that the drugs are harming people than helping them. If you interact with a complex system (our brains) in ways you don\\'t fully understand, you are far more likely to cause disruption than to enhance function. The problem is that any drug that causes a side effect that is also a symptom of the illness it is used to treat can be easy to overlook. Since people who are depressed are more likely to commit suicide, someone who does so while taking an anti-depressant is not thought of as being particularly unusual and it is easy to \"pin the blame\" on the depression as opposed to the drug.'),\n",

       "  'Blue eyes are what are called Autosomal recessive (this isn\\'t necessarily 100% true, but it is good enough we can work with it).\\n\\n\\nAutosomal recessive means that both alleles (meaning genes that you get from your parents) need to be recessive in order to be expressed in the offspring. \\n\\n\\nNow lets say that this blue eyed person\\'s alleles are represented by  \\'rr\\'. A person needs two little \\'r\\'s, one from the father and one from the mother, to have blue eyes. Here\\'s where it gets interesting. Father and Mother do not need to have blue eyes to necessarily have a blue eyed kid. If Mom has a Brown eyed allele and blue eyed allele, she will have brown eyes, but still carry a blue eyed gene, or what we would write as \\'Rr\\'. If the father has the same \\'Rr\\' pattern, then there is 1/4 chance of one of their kids getting \\'rr\\' and having blue eyes. Also, they will have a 1/2 chance of getting a kid with \\'Rr\\', meaning the gene is still present, even if it isn\\'t being expressed. \\n\\n\\nA one more point before I wrap up with an answer. Since blue eyes do not necessarily put a person at risk of early death in the wild, they are not selected against in population. The lack of disadvantage means that the likelihood of someone with blue eyes living as long as someone with brown eyes is pretty good, and increases the chances of a blue eyed person mating with another blue eyed person, or a brown eyed person with an \\'r\\' allele. You could even argue that blue eyes are selected for in modern populations, as some consider those with blue eyes more attractive and therefore increase that person\\'s chances of mating (although the applicability of that could definitely be questioned).\\n\\nIn short\\n\\n\\nBecause a gene can be carried without being expressed in a person, it can survive a surprising amount of time without ever showing up as a blue eyed person. All it takes to express that gene is one other person with that recessive allele to mate with them, and a blue eyed person can be born. And because blue eyes are not usually selected against in nature, when someone does appear with blue eyes they are just as likely to mate as any other member of the population, increasing the chances of persistence in population.\\n\\nEdit: I should have probably made this a bit more clear, eye color is not 100% controlled by one gene, it is controlled by quite a few genes that give each eye a unique hue and pattern. Eye color as whole however does work pretty well in models for autosomal traits. Just to clarify, eye color is a complex trait resulting from the interaction of MANY genes, not just one gene as previously thought. It\\'s not as simple as just being \"recessive\". \\n\\nAs someone else posted, recessive genes are only expressed if a person has two copies of them, one from each parent. They are not \"weaker\" than dominant genes.  Often what makes a gene recessive is that the protein it codes for doesn\\'t work or it has a different function than the dominant protein. In the case of eye color, blue eyed people don\\'t make as much melanin, which is a brown-colored pigment (protein) that also makes your skin tan and fruit turn brown when exposed to air. \\n\\nThat being said, recessive traits in general can be very common in a population if they are associated with a reproductive advantage. For example, dwarfism is actually a dominant trait, but it\\'s not very common because having two copies of the dwarfism gene causes a baby to be stillborn or die shortly after birth. So people with dwarfism typically have one dominant allele for dwarfism and one recessive allele for normal height. But the recessive gene for normal height is far more common in the population because babies with two recessive copies reproduce more frequently, thus passing on that gene more often. \\n\\nMore info on eye genetics: _URL_0_\\n\\nSource: I\\'m a high school biology teacher and my kids ask this question every year. I think you may have misunderstood how dominant and recessive genes work. [This has a lot of good information on the topic](_URL_1_). Note that there are a lot of other genes that go into eye colour, so in reality it\\'s much more complicated than what I\\'ll try to explain here. \\n\\n > But if blue eyes are recessive then surely nobody would have blue eyes today?\\n\\nWhy do you think this? The children of that original blue eyed person wouldn\\'t have had blue eyes, but they were carrying the blue eye gene that didn\\'t get expresed. Over the thousands of years, they have some kids, those kids have more kids, and eventually some of these distantly related cousins get together. The ones who each carry a blue eye gene have a chance of having blue eyed kids. You get half your genes from each parent, and if both parents have one blue eye gene and one brown eye gene (meaning they have brown eyes) you will have blue eyes if the halves you get each contain the blue eye gene. Recessive genes are no less likely to be inherited than any other. \\nThis means they get passed down to about 1/2 of a carrier\\'s progeny.  Recessive means they are only expressed when someone has a copy form both parents.   Odds are every carrier who reproduces is going to have at least one carrier descendant.  Nothing ever weeds the carriers out of the genome, and it takes genetic testing (or having a blue eyed kid) to even tell the gene is there.  Nothing ever selectively culls them out.  \\n\\nIt is likely the blue eyes mutation has occurred more than once.  If it did, science might be unable to tell the difference unless the populations were widely separated to prevent their descendants form interbreeding.

Human feces is full of bacteria that present a serious contamination risk.  Our repulsion to the smell is a probably an advantageous trait that motivated more primitive humans to poop away from living areas where the smell and consequently, the bacteria could not bother us.  Dogs do not have face a similar pathogenic threat from their feces.  Also, they can pick up valuable information via the smell of both theirs and other animal\\'s feces.  It would be much less advantageous for dogs to be disgusted by their poop. To a dog, a fecal smell is just a smell; its components convey information that may or may not be interesting. I don\\'t think dogs categorize smells as *bad* with the exception of something like skunk sprayed in their face. Unfortunately we use \"sensitive\" in two ways.  \"Fingers are very sensitive\" means they are capable of discerning lots of things through touch.  An \"open wound is really sensitive\\' means that it\\'s easily going to feel shitty with relatively little disturbance.  You\\'re imagining that \"sensitive\" for a dogs nose means that it\\'d be easily grossed out, or easily put-off by smellls (e.g. like a wound is sensitive).  In fact, dogs aren\\'t \"sensitive\" to smell in this fashion, obviously not as much as humans!  They are however capable of discerning smells from relatively little smell-material in the air.  Their ability to discern just doesn\\'t mean they are easily disturbed by what you\\'d call \" a bad smell \". I imagine that feces tell a very interesting story to the dog, much like a butt, crotch or fire hydrant provides information to a dog.

A guy who runs a kosher restaurant (Kosher laws, among other things, say no milk with cheese) can sue to prevent the government from enforcing that law against his business.

From what i\\'ve been told, they\\'ve changed that law so that now, the state doesn\\'t have to be a party in the lawsuit, and it can be brought on behalf of a person or a business.  The classic example here is discrimination lawsuits.  If I sue you and the company because you fired me because I am black, the state isn\\'t part of the suit.  Sure, the discrimination law was passed by the state, but the suit is Me v. You, The Company.  \\n\\nTraditionally, those cases were beyond the reach of the laws I described above.  This is because, while it\\'s one thing for the state to make you break your religious beliefs, it\\'s another thing for us to let one individual impose their religious beliefs on another person, let alone a corporate \"person,\" and, in the few instances where it might be a conflict, we as a society usually don\\'t care.

The idea is that now, if you are dealing with someone who has some power over you, like an employer, their religion becomes a defense for them against all manner of legal action.  Someone harasses you for being gay? The harasser can now argue that the law should have an exception for harassing people who are sinners? Some county in Mississippi finally passes an anti-discrimination act that protects you from being fired for being gay? doesn\\'t matter if the jury buys that discriminating against gays is a sufficiently important religious mandate for the owner or for the business. \\n\\nUltimately, the \"bullying\" language is political framing, but it is a real change in the law that will make it harder to pass effective anti-discrimination law, and harder for people to sue to counter the effects of certain kinds of discrimination.

The purpose of a router is to create a small sub-network (usually within the house) in order to be able to connect multiple computers at the same time, to the cable provided by the ISP.\\n\\nA computer on the internet can also function as a server. This means that it\\'s sole purpose is to provide data to other computers on the network, when requested. This is how sites like Reddit operate. Your computer sends a request to the servers of Reddit, and their servers in turn return the content of the site to your computer The internet is just a general term for a bunch of interconnected computer networks run by different Internet Service Providers (ISPs). These networks interconnect at carrier-neutral internet traffic exchange facilities which are located in most major cities around the world. At these facilities, different ISPs can interconnect (peer) with each-other directly to exchange traffic, or they can peer with IP Transit providers who act as intermediaries to facilitate connections and traffic exchange between two ISPs that don\\'t peer directly with each other.\\n\\nThese interconnections between ISP networks are almost always done using fiber optics (sending laser light through small glass fiber strands within a cable). Fiber optic cables can be used over very long distances (with repeaters) and there exist many undersea fiber optic cables that connect ISPs and carrier-neutral exchange facilities across different countries and continents.\\n\\nSatellites are not used to carry internet communications except in remote areas (usually only when there are no other alternatives). The reason for this is that satellite connections have relatively limited bandwidth (speed) for internet connectivity and more importantly they have a very high latency (delay / lag) which can make web browsing feel slow and can also negatively impact real-time voice/video calling and gaming.\\n\\nThe last-mile infrastructure connecting residential homes and businesses to local ISPs (like the local Telephone and Cable company) usually combines traditional copper wiring with newer fiber optic cabling. Some lucky people have Fiber To The Home (FTTH) directly from their ISP, but most people have traditional copper cabling wired to the home from a local telephone exchange or neighborhood node and then fiber optic cabling is wired from the ISP\\'s central/regional network facility to that exchange/node.\\n\\nRadio and microwave frequencies are used to carry internet communications, particularly for mobile devices / cell phones and Wi-Fi connected devices (with Wi-Fi, you connect your device to a local Access Point using microwave radiation and then that Access Point connects to an ISP usually via copper or fiber optic cabling). Radio and microwave frequencies are also used a lot for backhauls (e.g. for connecting cell phone towers to a central tower / facility) and for providing internet access to remote/rual communities.\\n\\nIn terms of different infrastructure in different regions, most developed countries have wired broadband internet to the home (via copper or fiber optic cabling), but in less developed countries there often isn\\'t any copper or fiber wired to the home so all internet connectivity must be done wirelessly though radio / microwave links and/or satellite communications.\\n\\n >  Are there computers made that don\\'t/can\\'t connect to the internet? \\n\\nYes, there certainly were computers sold up until the 90s that were not \\'internet ready\\' and required the purchase of a modem card or other similar add-on in order to connect to the internet (and some computers simply couldn\\'t connect to the internet even with add-ons).\\n\\nAlso, there are still some computers manufactured today that are not designed to connect to the internet, but these mostly come in the form of specialized embedded computers for things like controlling industrial machinery and whatnot. There aren\\'t any general purpose computers on the market today that lack internet connectivity capabilities.\\n\\n >  Was there a time period (sometime in the late 80s/early 90s) when \"internet capability\" was a selling point for new hardware and not a basic assumption?\\n\\nYes, very much so. Internet connectivity and modems were definitely optional in the 80s and even the early 90s; only some computers came with modems built-in as standard during that time - so that was a bonus / selling point.\\n\\nMost people couldn\\'t really get internet access in their home until the mid-1990s and most companies didn\\'t have websites until the mid-to-late 1990s. While the internet did exist before then, the web was very new in the 90s (note the distinction between the internet and the web).\\n\\nSo technically there were computers in the 80s and early 90s which could connect to the internet or connect to other computers directly (via calling those computers over a telephone line), but there wasn\\'t really a global web of internet websites like there is today until a little later on (mid-90s as I said).\\n\\nAlso, there wasn\\'t a lot of support for internet connectivity built into computer Operating Systems at the time. Windows 95, for example, was shipped without a Web Browser and without support for TCP/IP (the main protocol used for networking / internet connectivity). In order to get connected online, you had to install additional software components and a web browser on top of Windows (plus have the appropriate modem hardware installed).\\n\\nTo clarify the distinction between the internet and the web; the internet just refers to the whole network of computers/devices that are connected together (where each device is addressable and can communicate with any other device on the network). The web is a subset of the internet that is used for delivering content to users in the form of HTML formatted webpages that are displayed inside a web browser. Today, most of the stuff we do online is done via the web, but the internet existed for quite a while without the web and even when the web was introduced, other non-web internet services remained popular for a long time. In a really simple way:\\n\\nImagine the data travels in a road.\\n\\nYour driveway is the connection to your ISP.\\n\\nYour driveway is connected to a road that leads to a few different highways. (backbones).\\n\\nEach highway has many exits leading to other highways. Sometimes it leads to bridges. Sometimes to underwater tunnels. Sometimes to an airplane. Each way is either faster or slower but if say a bridge is shut down you can take the slower airplane. This is where the Internet\\'s power comes in. If one path is closed another one is available.\\n\\nTo reach your destination you go to an exit. There\\'s a guy there who you ask how to get to your destination. He says I don\\'t know but I know that the left path and right path know and the left path has less cars on it. You keep doing this until the guy says go to that driveway. Each exit you reach is called a hop. The less hops the faster the data transfer is. Sometimes the hop leads to an underwater cable. Sometimes satalite. Each path has different speeds and you try to take the fastest one.'),\n",

       "  '1) Senators are normally seated in January.  The race between Al Franken and Norm Coleman was very close (~300 votes). This led to recounts, which led to lawsuits, which led to more recounts. Al Franken (who would\\'ve been #60) was not seated until July 7.\\n\\n2) Ted Kennedy was dying and had not cast a vote since April 2009 or so. After he died in August 2009, he was replaced by Paul G. Kirk until a special election could be held.  Due to more lawsuits, Paul G Kirk served from  Sept 24 2009 to February 4 2010.  Scott Brown (R) won that special election, bringing the Senate Democrats down to 59 votes, and unable to break a filibuster by themselves.  Note that Sept 24-Feb 4 is about 20 working days, due to recess and holidays.\\n\\n3) So, for about 20 working days, the Senate Democrats could have broken a filibuster if you could get every single one of them to agree on something. This is not an easy thing to do. Some of the members had ideological differences. Some of the members realized that being absolutely vital like this gave them leverage, and wanted to be sure that they got *their* legislative goals.\\n\\nThis did not go well. Obama has never had a super-majority.  Super-majority is 2/3 or 66% of seats... in BOTH houses.\\n\\nI believe Obama only had a super-majority in the House for two years, and the Senate was 51/49* at best (it changed a lot with independents, who those independents joined for caucus, vacant seats, party changes, blue-dogs, etc.).\\n\\nAnd they passed Obamacare / ACA which was absolutely groundbreaking in terms of legislation... so I wouldn\\'t say he didn\\'t get anything passed, not by a long-shot.\\n\\n* **Edit**: the best Obama had was not 51/49 in the Senate, thank you for pointing out the inaccuracy here.  It was 57 with 2 Independents who tended to caucus with them.  And yes, sometimes a super-majority is considered 60 seats, depending on what type of vote it is... many cite the filibuster-breaker number of 60.  Either way, Obama still never had a super-majority, point stands. To break the filibuster in the Senate (which has been used an unprecedented number of times since Obama took office) a 60-senator vote of cloture is needed.  Obama never had the 60 votes in actuality, though he did on paper.  The reason is that Al Franken\\'s seat was contested for several months and Senator Byrd (D-WV) was hospitalized.  When Franken was sworn in, the number on paper was 60, but w/o Byrd being physically there to vote for cloture, the filibuster was effective.  The death of Ted Kennedy took another seat away from the Dems.  So, while there was a brief semblance of 60-senator super majority, that super majority only existed on paper since circumstance always had them at least one vote short.  As such, the Republicans could and did use the filibuster to halt the Senate. Obama\\'s 60 senate vote and majority house was precarious because most of those democrats were \"blue dogs\", who were new democrats in traditionally republican spots.  \\n\\nIf they towed too closely to democratic line, without pushback, they would be seen as democratic lackeys, and would be voted out of office.\\n\\nAs they were, when they were accused of towing democratic party lines for the health care vote, and those spots reverted back to republican in 2010. Since the question was answered, I want to make sure it is clarified that as the president, Obama doesn\\'t write legislation.  Congressmen in committees do.  All the president can do is promise not to veto.  So any legislation being considered was not \"Obama\\'s laws\", even if he liked the concepts, they were more laws of either the congressmen writing them, or of the Democratic Party as a whole drafting them.\\n\\nIs is very dangerous to overstate the powers, authority, and influence of the presidency, because the media loves using that singular posistion as a scapegoat for everything and anything federal in politics, when the presidency is only constitutionally guaranteed to fulfill the role of *executor* of policy, and their only legitimate say in the legislative process is the veto.  They don\\'t write bills, and if they say they \"proposed\" legislation, with the exception of the federal budget, it is purely outside of constitutionally granted authority. That\\'s a false premise, both in him having supermajority and not being able to pass *any* legislations he wanted. TL;DR version: There aren\\'t very many liberal Republicans. There are a fair number of conservative Democrats. The first two years of Obama\\'s term were among the most productive in the history of Congress.  \\n\\n_URL_0_\\n\\nSo, to explain like you\\'re five, the underlying factual assumption in your question is incorrect. The democrats had 60 seats in the senate for a very short time, because Al Franken had no been seated into mid-March, and Ted Kennedy died, opening his seat up for Scott Brown. 60 is the required number for cloture to force a vote over a filibuster. And quite franky, they did pass some legislation he wanted (Obamacare), it\\'s just that 538 adults with their own agendas are hard to force to work together. Because controlling Democrats is like herding long-tailed ADD cats in a room full of sparkled yarn balls and rocking chairs.\\n\\nTo quote Will Rogers: \"I am not a member of any organized political party. I am a Democrat.\" There have been a lot of excuses posted here but they are really just excuses. The opposing party has been unhappy and unhelpful to every president. Obama even having close to a supermajority should have been enough for him to get things done. \\n\\nThe real reason he wasn\\'t able to pass legislation was that he simply didn\\'t have the experience in leadership that was needed to get things done. Not only that but Congress is very tenure driven and they all have huge egos. Obama was there such a short time he never earned their respect which made it much harder to get them to do things.\\n\\nI voted for Obama in 2008 but that was my big concern in doing so. Congressmen don\\'t typically make good Presidents because they are a completely different skillset. Add on top of that his lack of experience in the Senate and he went into the presidency with a major handicap. \\n\\nI think it\\'s too bad he didn\\'t wait 8 years. He could have been one of our best presidents if he had gone in with more experience and more respect from the Congress. Could be anecdotal, but I\\'ve heard Democratic party isn\\'t completely lockstep with the President or the rest of the party compared to the Republicans. I recall hearing during the Bush administration, the Republicans were basically reliable on getting his policies passed and only needed to woo a few Democrats whenever he needed something (and could get them easily). Compare that to Obama needing to woo a few Republicans plus make sure his whole party is unified.\\n\\nAnd to be completely anecdotal, I voted for the President, and I\\'m an independent. While I agree with the Democrats on most issues and support them, they\\'ve been pretty weak compared the Republicans from what I\\'ve seen. The Republicans seem to stick to their guns better than the Democrats, and the Republicans seem to have less in-fighting over policies.'),\n",

       "  'A \"type\" is the kind of thing something is.\\n\\nA flat head screwdriver is a type of screw driver; a screw driver is a type of tool; a tool is a type of object; etc.\\n\\nIn programming languages (\"type systems\"), we have to tell the computer what kind of data the binary is representing. This is handled by the type system of the programming language. We (usually) don\\'t want to use a sentence as a number or a game character as a piece of code. The type system allows us to say what kind of thing each bit of binary is, and have the compiler enforce this for us, by complaining when we use them wrong.\\n\\nIn mathematics, a \"type theory\" tells us the type of thing mathematical objects are. A number can be a natural number or a rational number or a real number. Some values are just true or false. It serves as a way to be specific what we\\'re talking about, which is why it comes up as an alternative to set theory - which is another way to be specific about what we\\'re talking about. (Both type theory and set theory make you define math objects a certain way, and have rules - called axioms - for manipulating them or making new things.) OK, so in all branches of math and computer science, you have expressions that are made up of a series of operands (numbers, strings, variables, etc.) and operators (plus, divide, etc.) In addition, you can call functions which accept arguments (input values, usually separated by comma). \\n\\nA type system defines what kind of data each is operand is and which kinds of data are compatible with which operands. For example, in the Java programming language, there are several several ways to store numbers. The two main types are integers (char, short, byte, into, long) and floating point numbers (float, double). Integer types can store any positive or negative integer value within their range. They cannot store numbers with decimals, though. To store numbers with decimals, the programmer must use a float or double type. These types can store a range of numbers with decimal points, but I won\\'t bore you with the details.\\n\\nNow, as you have probably seen if you ever looked at code, programmers switch between types all the time. What if you switch from a double to an int though? In this conversion, you would lose any digits after the decimal point, and you could potentially have an over flow since doubles have a larger possible max value than ints because doubles have more bits (and other things which are beyond the scope of this post). The solution is the type system. The type system in the compiler does not usually allow this conversion because of the possible data loss. This protects the programmer from making a hard to detect mistake. To allow the conversion, the programmer has to explicitly tell the compiler he wants to to change the double to an int by using a typecast.\\n\\n  double d = 12.0d;\\n  int i = (int)d;\\n\\nWhat is the purpose, you might ask? At the lowest level, data in computers is stored as a number. When directly writing machine instructions, it takes a long time to program because of how easy it is to perform a math operation on an incompatible type (like trying to add 3 to a Boolean value, for example). Booleans are stored as numbers and so without the type system, the computer would perform the addition and the programmer wouldn\\'t know why his program wasn\\'t working. The type system sets rules to prevent the programmer from making mistakes.\\n\\nAnother example is boolean values. Boolean type values are true or false values. Let\\'s say we have two boolean variables, a and b which are both true. What if we do a + b? The answer is we can\\'t. The compiler gives an error because boolean (T/F) is not a number so they can\\'t be added. In other words, true + true has no result. A valid statement would instead be a AND b. Since a AND b are both true, a AND b = true. Likewise, we can\\'t evaluate 3 OR 4 because 3 and 4 are numbers, not booleans. They are the wrong type.'),\n",

On the surface this might seem like a fine idea but in reality it heavily restricts the ability of banks to lend; deposit only institutions can only lend out in loans (auto/mortgage/school/credit cards etc) what they receive in deposits minus the reserve share. The rest of the world decided not to follow the US example and never added such a restriction to their own banking codes.\\n\\nAfter the post WW2 growth started to slow in the late 60\\'s this problem grew, as banks couldn\\'t speculate using deposit funds the amount of credit available to both consumers and businesses was extremely limited which in turn was limiting new growth. To combat this Ginnie Mae (a company owned and operated by the federal government focused on helping to build home ownership) created the first Mortgage Backed Security in 1968 with both Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac refining the model over the next 15 years.\\n\\nMBS\\'s were designed as a way of skirting around the investment restriction by packaging up mortgages together and then offering slices of the package (securities) on the investment market. In effect rather then speculating with deposit funds, receiving returns and then using those returns to increase lending activity the banks moved the liability from themselves to investors which allowed them to lend more money (rinse, wash and repeat).\\n\\nBetween 1992 and 2000 the lending behavior of banks changed significantly. Previously they had been relatively conservative with whom they would lend money to but by the end of the period they were far more willing to lend to those with little or no credit. The reason for this change is still mostly disputed but a number of reasons that are commonly suggested:\\n\\n* Greed on the part of the banks\\n* Greed on the part of MBS investors\\n* A lowering of the minimum requirements to take up a mortgage by the federal government\\n* In 1994 HUD told banks that the racial makeup of their lending had to be representative of the areas they served, as such a bank with a 10% black population in the local community had to have 10% of their mortgages held by black people. Crucially the HUD regulatory note made no mention of the financial status of the people it was seeking to get mortgages offered to.\\n\\nIn reality it was likely a mix of all of the factors.\\n\\nSo the banks went about writing mortgages, packaging them up and selling them off. With the mortgages for those with below average credit (AKA sub-prime) the ratings agencies decided that while the risk of default was higher with those mortgages the rate of default would not be high enough to eliminate the profit generated from the interest payments. They based this on two assessments; most of the sub-prime mortgages were adjustable rate allowing the rates to increase if the cost of borrowing rose and an assessment from the federal reserve that interest rates were likely to stay low for the foreseeable future.\\n\\nIn reality the 2nd point turned out to be absurdly mistaken. The glut of mortgages had created a housing bubble which peaked in early 2007. When this bubble began to deflate rates shot up and suddenly these people with ARM mortgages could no longer afford their loans and began to default. On its own the housing downturn would have not been a big deal to the economy, we would have slowed down and the price of housing would have returned to where it should be with those on ABS\\'s refinancing or moving to a cheaper place; we would have had a mild recession but nothing particularly special.\\n\\nThe issue snowballed because of the way those mortgages were wrapped up. As the ratings agencies had decreed that sub-prime mortgages in large bundles had just the same risk as the prime mortgages they started to bundle them together. When people on the sub-prime adjustable rate mortgages started to default there was no way to unbundle these from the \"good\" mortgages and as such the MBS products rapidly lost value, while the peak default rate was 15% there was no way to know which parts of which MBS products were no longer \"good\" so all of them had to devalue to handle this.\\n\\nIn answer to the direct question the systematic issue that led to a bubble bursting causing a very deep recession was entirely regulatory, securitization (the process of turning mortgages in to MBS\\'s) was a creation of the federal government to work around its own banking regulations. The bubble itself was a combination of pumping by the federal government (well intention pumping but economically wrong) and greed by banks  &  investors. The bridge between the bubble bursting and the structural issue was ratings agencies and the federal reserve.\\n\\nTL;DR: Everyone fucked up.'),\n",

       "  'You are surrounded by noise, all the time. Unlike your eyes, which have built-in-light-blockers, your ears remain open and receiving stimuli 24/7 to the little hairs inside of your ear that translate vibration into signals for sounds.\\n\\nRemember when your Dad was telling you a really interesting story that you were completely focused and fixated on? Every word from his mouth triggered a sound wave to go into your ear, stimulate hairs, which then create signals that travel to your cortex. Think of the cortex as a room full of scientists crunching away on numbers and doing all manner of things that make you function. \\n\\nSo as your Dad is talking to you, your Cortex is firing away, releasing hormones, storing information, etc. etc. Imagine all these scientists making notes, writing down their own theories, connections between ideas, modifications to existing memories. Stacks upon stacks of paper.\\n\\nBy the end of the night, you\\'re tired -- and so is your cortex. But the world wont leave your cortex alone. As you slip on your pajamas, you stimulate more nerve cells which send signals to your cortex. When you brush your teeth, your cortex is putting in extra hours to handle all of those sensations. And as you lay down in your bed, even as still as you possibly can be, your cortex can\\'t escape the chirp of a cricket, or creep of a board, or scratch of a tree against your window.\\n\\nBut your brain needs rest. The cortex put in a long day\\'s worth of work, and needs to freshen up for another day of thinking. Your brain also needs to sift through all of the notes that were made during the day and file them into your memory library, move stuff around, clean up. So how do we stop the sensory signals? **Thalamus to the rescue.**\\n\\nThe Thalamus is the part of the brain that sensory signals must pass through in order to get to the cortex. Think of it as a guard with a velvet rope standing outside the Cortex room full of your thinkin\\' scientists. It has the power to deny sensory input from hitting the cortex and waking everybody up. It does this by releasing \"spindle\" brainwaves periodically through the night which block incoming sensory signals. The more frequent the spindles, the more able it is to keep anything from bugging the cortex.\\n\\nBut now we have a new problem -- the fact that our ears are constantly listening is a very good thing. It allows us to respond to threats or dangers when we are most vulnerable. So the Thalamus doesn\\'t make people go deaf to the world while they sleep. Rather, it does its best to eliminate noise and unimportant background sounds. So if you were used to sleeping in the country, out in the middle of nowhere, you would probable struggle to sleep in a busy city due to all the new sounds that would be hitting your ears. Your thalamus wouldn\\'t know what to do. It would be confronted with a new sound it had no clue what to do with and think, \"Well, dang... i better let the boss check this out,\" then pass it to your cortex and wake everybody up. It\\'s not just that the sounds would be louder in the city vs. the country. If you took someone living in the city and placed them out in the middle of nowhere, the \"sound\" of silence may be enough to keep your Thalamus on edge. Likewise, the chirping of crickets could become maddening.\\n\\nIn other words, we acclimate and adapt to \"background\" noise and our brain auto-filters it out so that it can rest. It\\'s why people who travel a lot often bring white noise machines, as it provides a constant form of noise that muffles out foreign noises, and it stays consistent from place to place making it super easy for your Thalamus to flag it as useless and not wake you up.\\n\\n**With that said**... more specifically to the heart of your question: Why do you wake up when your family/SO make gentle sounds, but can sleep through other common noises?\\n\\nWell, just as it is important for your Thalamus to be alerted to new/different sounds for the sake of threats and dangers that may occur while sleeping, there are certain sounds that are so inherently important to us that they act as a sort of \"fire alarm.\" In other words, you care a lot about your family and SO. They are likely on your mind a lot, and your Cortex has spent a lot of resources making sure they are safe, etc. etc. As a result, the Thalamus will pass those sounds through as well to wake the brain up. A baby crying, for example, is one of the most disturbing and hard-to-acclimate sounds for your brain... which is a good thing if you\\'re a deep sleeper and you need to help your baby. Similarly, certain peoples\\' voices, or hearing a specific word (like your name), or creek can all get waved through due to their deep-rooted affect on your brain.\\n\\n*tl;dr:* You love your family more than you love birds, TVs, and other environmental noises. You know it. Your cortex knows it. And Thalamus totes knows it.\\n\\n-------\\n\\nBonus science: Even when you are completely awake, your brain is still muting out stimuli. It\\'s why you don\\'t really notice or think about the fact that you have clothing touching your skin for most of the day, yet you\\'d immediately feel someone gently moving their finger across your shirt. Likewise, there\\'s a ton of sounds going on that are only manageable because your brain has been dealing with it since before you were born. In fact, one of the issues with people who are born with hearing impairments and then later get something like a cochlear implant to allow them to hear, is that their brains aren\\'t efficiently wired to deal with all the new stimuli and it struggles to separate \"noise\" from \"important sounds.\" Also, this is one of the hardest issues to overcome when dealing with voice inputs for computers. People can easily listen to multiple conversations happening in the same room, but without the right filtering (which a computer lacks) it is just a room full of noise bouncing off noise.\\n\\n**Double edit bonus:** I really don\\'t want to study right now, so I thought I\\'d add another interesting thing about all of this re: marketing. \"Ad blindness\" is a problem that marketers are constantly trying to find a way around. It\\'s why Facebook got into so much trouble when they used pictures of your friends in targeted ads. Everyone thought it was creepy -- and it was -- but it was also genius. You see many people every day. In your life, you\\'ve seen thousands of faces of thousands of people. But it too becomes noise. However, **familiar** faces get priority access to your brain\\'s attention/focus. So your brain may ignore ads on a website to the point that you genuinely never know they exist because your eyes refuse to look -- but add a picture of a friend, and BOOM -- an ad has your attention. Similarly, if you listen to morning radio shows, pay attention to the commercials. Often times, they will select a voice that is very similar to the host of whatever morning talk show is on (or just pay the talk show host to read an ad). Why? Because your brain zones out when it doesn\\'t care, and it does it **really** well... but if you can connect something that a person is familiar with, then it acts as a trojan horse. It\\'s the same reason celebrities are hired to be spokespeople. Millions of people become familiar with an individual\\'s face, voice, brand, etc... and simply placing that person next to a product can be enough to sneak the ad past your brain\\'s senses. \\n\\nAlright, I\\'m done for now.

The tests include questions about material students should be learning in school. It is so important that the students do well on these tests that school funding is often tied to them. Many teachers are forced to change how they teach so their students will do well on the test, but that doesn\\'t always mean the kids are learning more.\\n\\nFor example, a history teacher may do an excellent job teaching students about the antebellum south, what life was like for slaves, and the complicated social and economic factors leading up to the civil war. Even if students deeply understand the time and setting for the conflict, if all the test asks is \"what year did Lincoln sign the emancipation proclamation,\" from the tests perspective that teacher has failed. I\\'m speaking as a university lecturer, rather than a teacher, but I\\'d imagine the reasons are similar.\\n\\nAny subject area is potentially a vast landscape of ideas, knowledge, terminology, almost bottomless in depth. In a course that maybe lasts anywhere from 20 hours minimum to 60 or even 80 hours, as a teacher you could cover quite a lot of ground. \\n\\nA test is essentially a benchmark, a way for the student to demonstrate that they have acquired sufficient information in order to \"pass\". \\n\\nObviously the length of a test is but a fraction of the time spent learning the material, so often the test can only hope to cover a portion of the material covered in class. That\\'s the first problem: that the ability of a test to encourage the student to demonstrate the richness of the subject area, and thus of their understanding of it, tends to be somewhat limited.\\n\\nThe second problem is the distinction between information and knowledge (or understanding). When, because of funding pressures or other reasons, teachers find themselves forced to \"teach to the test\", they find themselves focusing not on the aforementioned vastness of the subject, but on the specific things that will come up in the test. This can lead to a shift away from helping to instill knowledge and understanding in the student, and towards simply furnishing them with information. To give you an example: I know next to nothing about physics but I feel fairly confident that if sufficiently drilled, I could learn sufficient terminology answer a basic test, without necessarily understanding the full implications or context.\\n\\nBasically it can be difficult for a test to truly provide evidence of actual knowledge in the student. I\\'m generalising a bit here, it depends on the subject area and on the design of the test.\\n\\nBut the short of it is this: many teachers love their subject area. they love thinking about it, and they love its richness and depth. By teaching \"to the test\", they feel (probably correctly) that they are doing something they love a genuine disservice. Teaching to the test means that teachers have to teach a large quantity of information without focusing on transferable skills like critical thinking analysis, and forming one\\'s own opinion. I very passionately believe that teaching is about teaching students how to learn, think, and advocate for themselves, but, with \"teaching to the test\" time for debate and critical thinking goes by the wayside in my classroom.'),\n",
       " ('Why human cloning is considered unethical?',\n",
       "  '>  So for me cloning sounds like an amazing opportunity to start from scratch and have a normal life.\\n\\nYou do know cloning doesn\\'t work like that, right? Cloning is just a way to make a baby with the same DNA as its \"parent\". This baby is an entirely separate individual, it still needs to grow, and despite having the same DNA it can still have a completely different personality, based on its life experiences. First, just a note, there\\'s a lot of different kinds of cloning (single tissue, single organ, whole individual, etc). Whole individual is the one considered unethical, and what we\\'ll talk about. \\n\\nAnyway, there\\'s a couple issues here:\\n\\n1. Cloning technology has a long way to go. . Clones don\\'t live nearly as long as naturally conceived members of the species, and have all kinds of health problems. To create a human clone would be to deliberately create a living, thinking individual who will never have a normal life due to health complications caused by the cloning process. That is considered very unethical. \\n2. Some are concerned that clones wouldn\\'t have the same rights as regular humans, and may be created only to provide genetically-identical replacement organs and the like for transplant into the original. \\n3. What you\\'re describing - creating a new individual to give a better life to than you had - applied to just having children normally. Whether or not they\\'re genetically identical to you, or even related at all, you have an opportunity to give them a better, happier life. You don\\'t need cloning for that. Some reasons.\\n\\n1) Religion. If cloning succeed, it either means that soul does not exist, either that human successfully created souls, either than not every human-like has soul, either that God created a soul for the clone and approved that kind of scientific experience. And most likely, there is no way of saying which one is \"right\", leading to a lot of morality questions.\\n\\n2) Human experimentation. Experience mean failures, and sometimes failure that look like success until too late. Animal experimentation are already at the limit of the morality, so human experimentation...\\n\\n3) Human great replacement fear. People fear that immigrants them. They fear that AIs replace them. So of course they fear that clones might replace them.\\n\\n4) Eugenisme. If clonage is possible, most likely you can make \"improved clonage\", with better capacities. Why \"improving humanity\" by genetic selection is unethical is another (quite complex) question, but it is currently considered as unethical. While this might not directly answer your question, one thing you might want to consider is that your clone wouldn\\'t be *you*.  You\\'d still be you.  Your clone will just have the same genes as you, but that\\'s only a tiny part of who you are - and, more importantly, even if you had an exact copy of yourself, your consciousness is still *yours*, so you wouldn\\'t consider that copy as \"you\".\\n\\nIt\\'s like having a child.  They might have half (or more!) of your genes, but you don\\'t think of a kid as \"you having an opportunity to start from scratch\".  People want their children to have a better life than they did, of course - that happens with *any* children, though, not just clone children. Have you heard that some scientists are currently attempting to help PTSD and depression by eliminating bad memories from your brain?  That might be something you wanna try rather than cloning.\\n\\nBut to answer your question people think cloning is going against god himself.  In addition, people don’t like that science could potentially mess up and make a deformed clone or something.  I think it’s more about doing the research and getting it to work and I’d be fine with cloning. > A opportunity to start in a better place.\\n\\nBut it wouldn\\'t be your opportunity, just some random other kid\\'s.

Accepting it is akin to saying \"i am a catholic, and unified with all other catholics\" for someone who has not been properly inducted into the faith, accepting the communion is akin to a lie. Not all catholics believe in the strict interpretation of transubstantiaion. However it is a very important tenant, since to accept that belief is to accept thst you are unified with christ.\\n\\n4.

       "  \"Because we are born before our heads get too big to come out of a woman's pelvis. We are MUCH weaker than other mammals at birth. Many take minutes, hours or days to walk. We take a year or more. \\n\\nThis is caused by two parts of our evolution. 1, we have large brains and need a large head to accommodate them. That means that we need to be born before our heads get very big. \\n\\nTwo, being upright instead of on all fours limits how much the pelvis can spread. So a woman's pelvis is narrower than typical for a mammal and a baby's head is larger than normal for a mammal. This all results in babies needing to be born waaaaay before most mammals do. Part of the reason is that pigs are not wild animals. They're domesticated animals bred for thousands of years for traits favorable for humans. There are various problems that can occur if an animal grows too fast, such as negative permanent consequences for temporary shortage of food or less-than-ideal food. But when you're raising pigs for slaughter, you want them to grow as quickly as possible, because you'll spend less time unprofitably raising them. So humans selected pigs to grow quickly (same with all domesticated animals used for food) and make sure by feeding them that they won't suffer problems due to temporary food shortages. And they don't have to worry about being ungainly and unable to flee from predators. So in short, humans have bred igs to grow very quickly. Wild pigs don't grow as quickly or as large. But at the same time, humans are at the extreme end of slow growth for mammals. Humans have I think the longest period of time when they are growing and developing prior to full maturity. Human adolescence doesn't end until age about 25, while sexual maturity occurs around age 14 or so (in human evolutionary history. Humans mature faster now due to diets higher in carbohydrates and less exercise). This is because humans rely on learning very complex skills that take a lot of time no matter what you do. \\n\\nSo you have an extreme contrast here--one of the slowest growing mammals and a mammal that has been artificially selected for thousands of years for fast growth.\"),\n",

Because the heat within the meat will continue to cook it after it has been taken off the grill.\\n\\nYour meat works exactly the same. The cells have so much heat that they transfer it deeper into your tissue, further damaging it. Cold water helps take that heat away before it has a chance to conduct deeper into you.

A traditional bit has 2 states, on or off. A quantum bit can be 70% on, and 30% off, or anything in between. Here\\'s the ELI5 version. Quantum particles are not reacting to observation- they are reacting to the  interaction with other particles. In order to observe a particle, there must be a chain of interactions between that particle to another particle and so on, eventually all the way to you.

So they had to skip Windows 9 because of the risk it would be accidentally treated as an old Windows version by some apps, causing compatibility issues.

At Microsofts first Windows 10 briefing they said they wanted to do windows 9, but it was \"too much of a technological leap to just go up one number\". They also considered calling it Windows 1 to fall in line with their other products (Xbox One, OneDrive, OneNote etc) but then they realised Windows 1 already exists so they went with 10. I’m sure their marketing teams have done in depth analysis to determine that the number 9 won’t sell well. \\n\\nMaybe they figure people would rather wait for the 10.

       "  'First of all, today they don\\'t. Google has said publicly that their driverless cars aren\\'t ready to handle that kind of weather yet, and no other car claims to be able to handle it. That\\'s one of many reasons why driverless cars aren\\'t allowed on public roads without a licensed human driver at the wheel ready to take control at any moment.\\n\\nSomeday, they\\'ll probably be able to handle it.\\n\\nRemember, our sensors are impaired too! Our sensors are our eyes and our ears, plus our perception of the movement of the car. In heavy weather we can\\'t see as well or hear as well - so we need to drive more slowly to account for the increased difficulty.\\n\\nSomeday driverless cars will be able to handle it too. Yes, their sensors will be impaired, but they\\'ll do the best they can because they\\'ll be trained in those conditions and they\\'ll know what speeds are safe. Remember, they don\\'t have to drive perfectly to make sense, they just have to drive better than a human driver.\\n\\nConsidering how many accidents humans cause in those conditions, I don\\'t think it will be that hard for machines to do better. Driverless cars are fairly new.  The immediate presumption people have when faced with something new is to throw it out if it isn\\'t perfect.\\n\\n > Wouldn\\'t the sensors be impaired?\\n\\nWouldn\\'t the designers and manufacturers plan for this?

Why wouldn\\'t cars a decade newer be able to do this and do it better?\\n\\nSimply put, sensors account for this as well.  You already having things like ABS for such conditions, and the sensors would just be an extension of what\\'s already in place. I don\\'t have a driverless car but I do have a car with sonar, used for parking, lane changing, and adaptive cruise control.\\n\\nIn heavy rain the sensors for all of those features worked just fine. However, in heavy snow, it was useless. Interestingly enough, the car knew this so it just gave a \"unavailable\" message instead of incorrect readings. Part of the sensors role is to detect weather conditions like ice and snow. They can detect very accurately how much grip they have on the road and will slow down in hazardous conditions. However a very sudden change may be difficult, but that would also be the same for a normal driver. Driverless cars are not to the point in development that we have answers for this. They are still in very early testing and methods for handling those conditions have not yet been developed yet alone implemented.

       " ('How is being dyslexic in symbol languages (Chinese, Japanese, Korean) different from being dyslexic in English?',\n",
       "  'I am dyslexic and it is actually quite commonly said that dyslexia doesn\\'t exist in China, it\\'s a bit more complex than that, but basically, the characters do not affect dyslexics in the same way as letters do. \\n\\nThese are a few interesting links that should tell you more, firstly an article about someone who is severely dyslexic in English but not at all in Japanese - _URL_1_\\n\\nThe second is an article on the discovery that chinese \\'dyslexics\\' actually suffer from a deficiency in a totally different part of the brain to english ones - _URL_0_ My understanding is that dyslexia is primarily (in about 80% of cases) a disorder of phonemic processing; i.e. the capacity of the brain to order sounds into meaningful chunks. I assume that languages which represent *meaning* with characters such as Chinese and Japanese take some of this work out the equation: for example the Japanese character for fire (火) can be pronounced a few different ways, but it always has the meaning \"fire.\" This versus English and other languages whose writing only carries meaning *after* you\\'ve done the phonemic assembly required, meaning that \"f.i.r.e.\" means nothing until you\\'ve put the letters together and translated them mentally into a sound. I would assume that what you would see in languages like Chinese and Japanese is people with dyslexia having an easier time unless something was written in the phonetic Pinyin or Kana (for Chinese and Japanese, respectively) at which point presumably some of the phonemic processing issues would emerge. \\n\\nThere is also a small subset of dyslexics (20% or so) where the issue lies in visual/spatial processing, and has to do with the brain not being able to correctly mentally orient letters. I imagine for these folks Chinese might be a little easier because the complexity of the characters would help you to find the meaning regardless of its perceived orientation, but you would probably still have a hard time. \\n\\nSource: I\\'m a pediatric occupational therapist who has read some books and articles in addition to working with lots of kiddos with language-based learning disabilities. The piece about dyslexia being based in phonemic and sometimes spatial processing is well-established neuroscience. The piece about why it might be different in pictographic languages is my educated speculation, so let the reader beware. Hey Redditor!\\n\\nMy degree background is in Psycholinguistics, which is basically put: understanding how language functions in the brain. \\n\\nI actually did a research project on dyslexia and hope I can be a help explaining it.\\n\\nSo, symbol languages, in linguistic terms, is called a logographic system. This basically means that the language is communicate (in writing systems) through logos, or symbols, representing - usually - a \"chunk\" or what is called a morpheme. A combination of these morphemes in a particular pattern and combination represent a word or phrase.\\n\\nLanguages like English are considered alphabetic (cause - you know - the alphabet).\\n\\nThere\\'s a lot of different things to consider you\\'d need more information from studying to field, but basically our ability to read has mapped on to previously developed parts of the brain, utilizing their functions to process language. For alphabetic system, they are usually called \"t-junctions\" meaning before modern times, letter like the \"o\" weren\\'t actually round, but were a series of lines making almost a diamond shape that has altered over the years to the circular \"o\" we all know and love.\\n\\nAlphabetic languages actually access a part of the brain (which I can\\'t currently recall) that has to do with your lexical phonetic storage system - meaning you link the letter to a specific sound (with has its variations between words in English... but that\\'s a different topic all together). That is how it is simply organized.\\n\\nLogographic systems actually activate parts of the visual cortex not activated in alphabetic systems (or only activated minimally). There are actually MRI testing that has been done on this demonstrating the results.\\n\\nWhat\\'s really cool is the fact that because these two systems of writing/reading don\\'t full connect, a person who is dyslexic in one system, such as English, could be fully able to read and write with easy in another system, like Japanese, because of this lack of overlap between logographic and alphabet systems (you can find case studies on this which are actually pretty rad!) \\n\\nThere is much debate as to why dyslexia happens in the first place, but some of the best journal articles dispute that it has to do with the fact that writing and reading is a relatively new systems to our brains, and might have to do with the fact we are utilizing previous skills for other task that have evolved in our brain, to map the ability to read and write and make it accessible.\\n\\nIf you have any questions about it, or want me to send some academic literature your way, PLEASE reach out! I nerd out over stuff like this  < 3 On a side note: Korean, or Hangul, is read kinda like English. Korean \"symbols\" are actually just a few letters crammed into a little block. It\\'s like taking the word \"talk\" and rearranging the letters in a 2x2 grid:\\n\\nt a\\nl k\\n\\nEdit: words Just a side point... Korean is actually a phonetic language with an alphabet -- much more phonetic than English.  You could learn to read it in about 20 minutes if you have the time.  So dyslexia in Korea is pretty much the same as in English\\n\\n(Source, I\\'ve been living and studying in Korea now for several years) I have dyslexia and have studied about dyslexia previously. Dyslexia is a specific learning difficulty similar to dyspraxia, dyscalculia and ADHD. All of the overlap and it is extremely common to have more than one (I have dyslexia and dyspraxia). \\n\\nDyslexia has a lot more to it than just have difficulty reading and writing, it come with difficulties in memory, attention, word finding, organisation, time management and so many other areas. Other language difficulties can include difficulties knowing which sentence particles to use, confusing similar or opposite words (e.g. Left and right), difficulty structuring sentences so that they make sense, and knowing which tense to use and the different conjugation of words (e.g. What is the past tense of \\'write\\'). These are all things that would be experienced regardless of the language you speak/read. \\n\\nAs an adult my main difficulties are not to do with reading and writing, they are to do with memory and organising my though processes. I make a lot of speech errors, I find it very hard to explain things in a logical way even though they make perfect sense in my head. In terms of writing my difficulties are in structuring my ideas. I do still have difficulty with reading and writing but I\\'ve learned to manage this over the years. \\n\\nTL;DR there is a lot more to dyslexia that spelling and reading, most of which would happen regardless of the language used. Just want to clarify that while Chinese is a symbol language, Korean (hangul) and Japanese (hiragana/katakana) are alphabetical, though they often refer back to the Chinese symbols (especially in Japanese). Dyslexia is a problem with the brain\\'s interpretation of relating written language to the sounds they make. In a nutshell, there is no difference in how dyslexia affects english-speakers vs East Asian languages.\\n\\nThe scrambling of letters explanation people give for dyslexia is an analogy for how the brain mixes up sounds/words. It isn\\'t exactly what dyslexia does. Korean is NOT a \"symbol language\", btw. It has an alphabet like English. In fact, considering how shit our spelling system is, we\\'re practically a symbol language compared to it. Dyslexia is a condition where the brain struggles to translate a written language to a non written one, ie the voice in your head when you read or write. \\n\\nProsopagnosia is the inability to recognise faces. So you could look at a person and have no idea who they are until they speak or you recognise their perfume or some other non face que. It is not an inability to see, just to process faces.\\n\\nDyslexia is similar - you can see the symbols, you know they come together and create meaning, but your brain struggles incredibly hard to figure out what that is. Good question, but an FYI. Korean is actually a phonetic language, and is in some ways, easier to use than english. Korean is not a \"symbol language\" if by that you mean logographical. If Korean is a \"symbol language\" then so is every language in Europe. \\n\\nJapanese is hardly one, too. They use occasional logographs but also have an alphabetic system.  \\n\\nEdit: OP you might enjoy this:\\n\\n_URL_2_ Just saying, the Korean language are not symbols, they don\\'t have a meaning in each character. While Japanese (kanji) , Chinese do I\\'m not an expert in dyslexia but am a Chinese speaker.\\n\\nWritten Chinese is not an alphabetic or syllabic language so dyslexia in Chinese is not really related with how sounds are represented but how the symbols are written. You know, Chinese characters are actually made up of components put in specific positions and written using a specific stroke order. If any of those components/strokes are **1)** missing or superfluous (e.g. 天 \"sky\" vs 大 \"big\", 日 \"sun\" vs 目 \"eye\"), **2)** put in the wrong place (e.g. 太 \"very\" vs 犬 \"dog\", 本 \"book/root\" vs 未 \"not yet\" vs 末 \"end\"), or **3)** wrongly written (e.g. 田 vs 由 vs 甲), it could cause problems for the readers.\\n\\n**Examples:**\\n_URL_7_\\nIn the the circled character above, some strokes are missing. (The correct form would be 麗 )\\n\\n_URL_8_\\nHere the upper part of the character is horizontally mirrored.\\n\\n_URL_7_\\nIn image 1.9, the second character (夫) has an extra horizontal stroke.\\n\\nIn image 1.11, the characters are supposed to be 唱歌 , which means in this case the left and right of the first character got reversed, and the wrong component is used in the right hand side of the second word.\\n\\nApart from the mistakes in how a character is written, there are also problems with the mixing up of characters similar in form or related in meaning.\\n\\n**Examples:**\\n_URL_9_\\nIn image 1.1, 橾 (ancient wheel hub) is used instead of 澡 (bath).\\nIn image 1.2, 炮 (a cannon) is used instead of 跑 (to run).\\n\\nIn image 1.3, 回學 should be 回校 . This happens because 學 and 校 are often used together. (學校 means school)\\n\\nOf course there are a host of other symptoms but I guess the above are several of the more obvious.\\n\\n**More examples:**\\n_URL_8_\\n_URL_9_\\n\\n**Reference** (in Chinese): _URL_9_\\n\\nEdit: formatting I am dyslexic and its not that you see stuff backwards its that the siginaling from your brain to you hands gets messed up amd I end up writing the wrong letter or 8 just skip words all together when I write. I really hate grammar Nazi btw There is a profound difference in the number of dyslexics between English and Japanese speakers.\\n\\nThis article places it at 5-6% dyslexics among English speakers compared to 1.5% in speakers of Japanese.\\n\\n_URL_10_ Korean is not symbolic, it\\'s alphabetic.\\n\\nJapanese is a mixture of both symbolic and alphabetic. \\n\\nAnecdotally, it\\'s very easy to be dyslexic in Chinese script and to even \"lose\" the written language. With an alphabet, like Hangul or Latin, it\\'s hard to forget because you use letters to construct words and sounds - words are always being built when written or said without much memorization. Chinese characters don\\'t carry sound and so must be memorized. If you didn\\'t do well in school, you\\'re kind of screwed. My dyslexia doesn\\'t allow me to write down the correct number on a piece of paper or say it correctly. I always manage to be a full power off. IE 1,234.56 - >  12,345.6 or 1,234.56 - >  123.45\\n\\nIf I see the number physically or hear it I have no issue. I do know if I formulate the number in my head I have a 50% of output it wrong. Purely anecdotal, and without any formal training in learning disabilities, but from my experience teaching English in Japan I think it can exist for Japanese people l. How would i know if I\\'m teaching them English? \\n\\nWell i have a few kid students who have severe trouble memorizing the alphabet as well as reading and writing basic words. All children struggle at first but these are long term students who still can\\'t even spell their names after studing for years. I speak japanese and ive started testing their japanese ability and even asked their parents about their regular school work and it seems they have a lot of trouble in school with Japanese. One kid couldnt even write his own name in Japanese as a 3rd grader in elementary. These kids are otherwise normal. Obviously our P\\'s, b\\'s, and d\\'s are very similar.  Same with lots of other of our letters.  It isn\\'t as bad in certain languages because of subtle differences in the characters in general and written stroke patterns.\\n\\nSource: am person with dysgraphia dyslexia who can read Japanese katakana with little trouble. Dyslexia is mainly a problem between the spoken and the written language. It can happen when you read or write. In general when you have it with writing the fingers type faster than you actually think the word, so in many cases certain letters are mixed up. And even when you read that word, with dyslexia your brain doesn\\'t recognize that you mixed these two letters up.  \\n  \\nI would imagine that this goes for all languages as people that have dyslexia in one language in general also have it in a 2nd or 3rd one they might learn.  \\n  \\nNow there are ways how to help kids with that and today with computers and word you barely see this happen in the everyday world as we all sometimes type faster than we think. And word knows how to correct these little problems quite well. My understanding is that there are many, many types of dyslexias, too numerous and can exhibit themselves in various intensity. While phonemic processing may be one type that some dyslexics suffer less with iconographic scripts, there are others (ex. difficulty navigating through tables) that they would do rather badly in, regardless of what language type is used. i think to get the conversation started on the right foot, we should all be aware that Korean is not a symbol language.'),\n",

But analysts need only be at least 51 percent confident of a target\\'s \"foreignness.\"\\n\\n**What is PRISM not?**\\n\\nIt is apparently not the name for an overarching secret surveillance program in affiliation with certain large tech companies, as was originally reported by The Washington Post. Director of National Intelligence James Clapper has released a statement saying, \"PRISM is not an undisclosed collection or data mining program.\" Instead, the name PRISM appears to refer to the actual computer program used to collect and analyze data legally requested by the NSA and divulged by Internet companies. This matches reports from CNET and The New York Times.\\n\\nHowever, as the New York Times reported late Friday evening, it has come to light that the nine large tech companies first reported to be working with the NSA to divulge information have, in fact, made it easier for the government to access data from their servers.\\n\\n**Which companies are involved?**\\n\\nMicrosoft, Yahoo, AOL, Facebook, Google, Apple, PalTalk, YouTube, and Skype. Dropbox is allegedly \"coming soon.\" However, 98 percent of PRISM production is based on just Yahoo, Google, and Microsoft.\\nAll nine of them have explicitly denied that the government has \"direct access\" to their servers. Reliable sources have confirmed to CNET that PRISM works on a request-by-request basis, rather than unfettered access, as was originally reported by the Washington Post. Here is a direct quote from our in-depth article on this issue:\\n\\n > Those reports are incorrect and appear to be based on a misreading of a leaked Powerpoint document, according to a former government official who is intimately familiar with this process of data acquisition and spoke today on condition of anonymity.\\n\\n\\n**So someone has read my e-mail?**\\n\\nAside from the fact that Google\\'s algorithms crawl your e-mail all the time to target ads at you, \"someone\" within the NSA/FBI/etc may have read your e-mails, *presumably with a proper warrant*.\\n\\n**Should I be outraged?**\\n\\nProbably! But maybe not. President Obama addressed PRISM on Friday and essentially said, \"Don\\'t worry. You can trust us.\"\\n\\n**Is it even legal?**\\n\\nYes, under Section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) of 2008 and the Protect America Act of 2007. Director of National Intelligence James Clapper released a statement Thursday night saying that \"Section 702 is a provision of FISA that is designed to facilitate the acquisition of foreign intelligence information concerning non-U.S. persons located outside the United States. It cannot be used to intentionally target any U.S. citizen, any other U.S. person, or anyone located within the United States.\" FISA was renewed last year by Congress.\\n\\n\\n**How does it work?**\\n\\nEssentially like this: The attorney general issues a secret order to a tech company to hand over access to its servers to the FBI. The FBI then hands that information over to the NSA.\\n\\nThis account matches what CNET has been told by our reliable source:\\n\\n > When the government delivers Section 702 orders, according to a former official, companies \"implement them just as though they would implement a wiretap -- there\\'s no direct access to servers.\" The order has to be for account information or an intercept directed at a specific foreign person, and \"you can\\'t say everyone in Pakistan who searched for \\'X\\'... It still has to be particularized.\"\\n\\nAccording to CNET\\'s source, both the contents of communications and metadata, such as information about who\\'s talking to whom, can be requested.\\n\\n**What\\'s the fallout?**\\n\\nWell, so far respected human rights watchdog Freedom House has downgraded America\\'s freedom ranking. Last time their survey was released, the United States was the second most free country on Earth in terms of Internet freedoms. That position is about to change.\\n\\n**How can I avoid this?**\\n\\nYou can\\'t.\\n\\n**What happens next?**\\n\\nA congressional hearing and an investigation into who leaked it. \"The unauthorized disclosure of information about this important and entirely legal program is reprehensible and risks important protections for the security of Americans,\" Clapper said in his statement.\\n\\nSo the answer is, nothing much.\\n\\n[Further Reading - DNI PRISM Fact Sheet](_URL_1_)\\n\\n[More - Parts of NSA\\'s PRISM program declassified](_URL_4_)\\n\\n**Edit:** *Removed - Inaccurate* - Not quite right at this point\\n\\n\\n**Edit 2:**  *Removed - Irrelevant*\\n\\n\\n**Edit 3:** /u/spacedawg_ie Posted a relevant video of the [NSA Head - Gen.

Potatoes grow easily and you can likely get a few harvests before winter. \\n\\nYou can supplement the calories by building a small chicken coop or you can get a cow if you have an acre for it to graze on.

Time *isn\\'t* space, space *isn\\'t* time, but the two are connected in interesting ways that means you can\\'t manipulate one without manipulating the other.\\n\\nIt all comes down to one of the main premises of relativity; the speed of light is the same in all reference frames. Once you take that idea and run with it, you need some way to relate different velocity frames given that you can\\'t just add velocities any more of the speed of light will change. It turns out that Lorentz transforms can do that for you. By expressing time and space as a single set of variables (in the notation, we use 4-vectors), you can apply your Lorentz transform and see what happens.\\n\\nWhen you do all the maths and get everything working consistently, you get results like the way time may pass at different rates in different frames. Our intuition also gets nicely mucked up by things like the relativity of simultaneity not actually being real - if two things are simultaneous to one person, another person may see them happen at different times.\\n\\nThis isn\\'t because time *is* a dimension of space, it\\'s because time and space are both related as parts of overall spacetime. Or at least, that\\'s how we describe it. It\\'s not, really. Think about it this way:\\n\\nSpace is 3-dimensional. This means that we can, in some sense, say that there are 3 \"different\" spaces, but if you put them together the right way, you get one 3-dimensional space. \\n\\nThe way that you put the separate spaces together is determined by a set of mathematical relations.\\n\\nWell, it turns out that the same relations, modified very slightly, can also by applied to the time dimension in order to create a 4-dimensional combination that we call space-time.\\n\\nThe Lorentz transformation is a way of changing how you label the different points in space-time. If an object is moving fast it uses a different set of coordinates.\\n\\nNow, you don\\'t *need* to use coordinates, but the math is easier if you do. A 1-dimensional space is not very interesting, but the way that you combine multiple dimensions together is very interesting. The most basic thing you add is the concept of a \"rotation\", which means being able to move between one sub-dimension into another.\\n\\nWhen we talk about space-time, we are talking about the structure that arises when we combine multiple boring dimensions into one big multidimensional space. Time by itself is boring. There\\'s almost no structure. It\\'s nothing more then a label for \"when\", and *that* doesn\\'t mean anything unless you can also say \"where\" and \"what.\"\\n\\nSo with the concept of space-time we can talk about \"rotations\" that change the relative amount that an object is aligned in any of the combined dimensions. Since time is one of the sub-dimensions, we can talk about object rotating into or out of the time dimension. (This is the role of velocity.)\\n\\nHowever, nothing with mass can completely rotate out of it. This is what gives us a maximum velocity (the speed of light), and this is also why the method of combination is slightly different from that of the three space dimensions alone. Also, you can\\'t rotate completely *into* it either, so there is a maximum amount of alignment. This basically means that you can\\'t go slower than stopped.'),\n",

       " ('How is aluminum produced?',\n",
       "  'Aluminum is produced from an ore called Bauxite, which is a naturally-occurring mixture of several Aluminum compounds as well as impurities of Iron. This ore is crushed and undergoes what is called the \"Bayer Process\" which converts the various compounds into Aluminum Oxide (Al2O3).\\n\\nThe first step of the Bayer Process is to dissolve the aluminum from the bauxite. This is done at high pressure and temperature in a Sodium Hydroxide (NaOH, a strong base) bath. You can add Calcium Carbonate here to help remove the silica (Si) compounds or you can remove them later in the process. The solution is cooled and the solid impurities are removed, leaving you with Sodium Aluminate (NaAlO2) and water.\\n\\nHistorically this cooled solution would then have Carbon Dioxide bubbled through it to create Aluminum Hydroxide (Al(OH)3), but it\\'s more efficient to instead \"seed\" the solution with some Aluminum Hydroxide crystals that you already have, which causes the Aluminum Hydroxide that\\'s in the tank to crystalize too. \\n\\n*But wait,* I hear you say, *I thought we had Sodium Aluminate in the tank?* \\n\\nWell, we did. And we also had Aluminum Hydroxide. Our NaAlO2/H2O solution exists in a natural equilibrium with a solution of Al(OH)3 and NaOH. The equilibrium heavily favors the side with NaAlO2, but once we start crystalizing bits of AL(OH)3 the equilibrium shifts towards them. (This is called Le Chatlier\\'s principle, and I can explain it more if you have more questions about it.)\\n\\nThe last step of the Bayer Process is to heat the Aluminum Hydroxide crystals in order to have them thermally decompose into Aluminum Oxide (Al2O3) and water.\\n\\nOnce we have the Aluminum Oxide, we can put it through another process which is called the \"Hall-Heroult Process.\" This process relies on a mineral called Cryolite, which, if you want to get technical, is Sodium Hexafluoroaluminate or Na3AlF6. You could potentially skip the Sodium Hexafluoroaluminate and just melt your Alumina (another name for Al2O3), but Alumina has a much higher boiling point and Cryolite dissolves aluminum salts and oxides quite well. Another advantage of Cryolite is that it doesn\\'t break down with high heat or electricity, the developers of this process tried using water first but ran into problems with it breaking down into H2 and O2 before any of the aluminum could be isolated. But I digress,\\n\\nOnce you have dissolved your Al2O3 crystals in Cryolite, you can run an electrical current through the solution. This electrical current gives the Oxygen and Aluminum enough energy to convince them to separate and find another thing to bond to. Typically a carbon anode (the \"positive\" side) is used. In the following equations *e^- * refers to an electron.\\n\\nCathode:\\n\\nAl^+3 +3e^-  **-- > **  Al\\n\\nAnode:\\n\\nO^-2  + C  **-- > ** CO + 2e^-\\n\\nSo overall:\\n\\nAl2O3 + 3C  **-- > ** 2Al + 3CO\\n\\nAlthough in practice there\\'s more CO2 produced at the anode than CO, the math isn\\'t quite as simple. Cryolite and Aluminum have very different densities, so it\\'s relatively easy to remove the Aluminum from the molten Cryolite.\\n\\nThat\\'s the primary production (new aluminum) anyway. Secondary production is completely different, and is put simply, just melting down scrap aluminum that has had impurities and paints removed from it. Secondary production is much more efficient than primary production and makes up about 40% of the North American aluminum supply.'),\n",

       "  \"Okay, as someone who is actually there maybe I can throw in my two cents\\n--------\\n\\n**Sunnis:** Angry Minority who have historically been leaders of the country, and are now relegated to being only part of the political process and not all of it. There was a Huge protest against Maliki's (Iraqi PM) sectarian method of running the government. Basically, anyone who was not playing ball was kicked out or ran out of the country. \\nFYI: Maliki is currently head of 4 ministries other then just being the Prime Minister, and not to mention all the other ministries that he defacto runs through his political party.\\n\\nISIS grows out of the frustration of the protests that were taking place against Maliki. They get trained in Syria, they come back and are welcomed in majority Sunni Mosul\\n\\n**Kurds**: Kurds never felt part of Iraq, as they were included within it by force. Kurdish forces are generally more organized and trained and have secured areas with Kurdish majority out of the KRG and are not willing to move out. They have made it clear they will not get involved in fights outside of their region, they have regularly been in contact with ISIS but have not seen the heavy fighting that others have because ISIS's goals do not include mainly Kurdish areas, however Mosul outskirts and Kirkuk will remain a flashpoint.\\n\\nKurds do not agree with Maliki as they push for a more federalist government, they are very very anti-centralist government\\n\\n**Shia**: The vast majority of the country, and as they have been historically oppressed despite their numbers, they are not willing to relinquish powers to Sunni's, as they have seen what powers to them could do. They have many different political parties within them, however Maliki's party, the State of Law, is the majority seat holder and thus is able to act more freely then other shia parties in the region. \\n\\nRecently got involved in the fight due to key Shia shrines in Samara'a as well as being a buffer to quell ISIS movement towards Baghdad.\\n\\n\\nIt's not expected that ISIS will actually gain any new cities, other then the Sunni cities of which they feel more comfortable in. They have the numbers and support of the people within those cities. But will remain a considerable power due to the looting of the bank, and the amount of heavy weaponry left behind by the fleeing Iraqi army in Mosul and Tikrit. Difference of religion like in the christian religion. From my understanding:\\n\\n1. ISIS is an offshoot of Al Qaeda\\n\\n2. They want to seize control of Iraq and create an Islamic caliphate. Mosul is the starting point, then tsirisk, and they also aim to seize Baghdad but they've been stopped in their tracks, for now.\\n\\n3.the growing tensions between the Kurds, Sunnis and Shiites have been bubbling since way before the Iran-Iraq war, Saddam used to butcher millions of Shiites and Kurds on a daily basis simply because they weren't Sunni looking forward for some good answers here... i too would like to understand what's up\"),\n",

       "  \"The Glasgow Scale is a way to quantify someone's Level of Consciousness and Orientation\\n\\nThree are three categories:\\n\\n* Best eye response\\n* Best verbal response\\n* Best motor response\\n\\nBest eye response is ranged from 1 to 4 where:\\n\\n* 1 = none (patient doesn't open eyes for anything\\n* 2 = to pain (patient only opens eyes to painful stimuli)\\n* 3 = to speech (patient only opens eyes to verbal stimuli)\\n* 4 = spontaneous (patient opens eyes without needing any stimulus)\\n\\nBest verbal response ranges from 1 to 5 where:\\n\\n* 1 = none (patient cannot speak)\\n* 2 = incomprehensible speech (attempts to speak are made but actual words are not understandable)\\n* 3 = inappropriate words (patient can speak more clearly but no sense can be made of them)\\n* 4 = confused (patient makes some sense but doesn't know one or more of the following (who he is, where he is, what day/time it is or what is happening at the moment)\\n* 5 = oriented (patient is fully oriented and has no confusion, speaks clearly and logically)\\n\\nAnd best motor response ranges from 1 to 6 where:\\n\\n* 1 = none (patient has no motor response to any stimuli)\\n* 2 = extension to pain (painful stimulus causes limb extension\\n* 3 = flexion to pain (painful stimulus causes limb flexion)\\n* 4 = withdraws from pain (pulls limb away from painful stimulus)\\n* 5 = localizes pain (moves hand to source of pain in attempt to remove the pain)\\n* 6 = obeys commands (normal voluntary motor response)\\n\\nSo a normal person with nothing wrong with them will have a GCS of 15. Someone who is confused but otherwise normal will have a GCS of 14. \\n\\nIn cases of dementia, Alzheimer's or other mental health problems, the patient may have a GCS baseline less than 15.
